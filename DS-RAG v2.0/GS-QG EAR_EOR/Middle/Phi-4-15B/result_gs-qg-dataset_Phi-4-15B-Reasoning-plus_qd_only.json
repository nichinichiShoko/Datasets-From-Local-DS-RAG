        "<think>We are given a set of facts in the form \"subject -> relation -> object\", with multiple lines. The task says: \"Use the full list\" and then produce one complete English sentence that uses all the info only in the facts and includes no additional info. We have a series of facts:\n\nFacts:\n1. born date -> (Who 's) -> first earliest,\n2. born date -> (of) -> David Bowie,\n3. born date -> (of) -> Johnny Depp,\n4. born date -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong,\n5. Neil Armstrong -> (attend) -> Purdue University,\n6. Neil Armstrong -> (later earn) -> degree,\n7. Neil Armstrong -> (involved in) -> controversies,\n8. What -> (is) -> born date,\n9. What -> (were) -> public's expectations,\n10. public's expectations -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong,\n11. public's expectations -> (after) -> Apollo 11 mission,\n12. Purdue University -> (on) -> naval scholarship,\n13. degree -> (in) -> aeronautical engineering,\n14. controversies -> (such as) -> criticism,\n15. criticism -> (he faced for his) -> perceived aloofness.\n\nWait, I'll re-read carefully:\nThe given facts:\n\n\"born date -> (Who 's) -> first earliest,\" \n\"born date -> (of) -> David Bowie,\"\n\"born date -> (of) -> Johnny Depp,\"\n\"born date -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong,\"\n\"Neil Armstrong -> (attend) -> Purdue University,\"\n\"Neil Armstrong -> (later earn) -> degree,\"\n\"Neil Armstrong -> (involved in) -> controversies,\"\n\"What -> (is) -> born date,\"\n\"What -> (were) -> public's expectations,\"\n\"public's expectations -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong,\"\n\"public's expectations -> (after) -> Apollo 11 mission,\"\n\"Purdue University -> (on) -> naval scholarship,\"\n\"degree -> (in) -> aeronautical engineering,\"\n\"controversies -> (such as) -> criticism,\"\n\"criticism -> (he faced for his) -> perceived aloofness.\"\n\nWe need to incorporate all these pieces of information in one complete sentence.\n\nLet's analyze each fact. The \"facts\" are in a graph-like structure. They seem to represent some relationships between subjects and objects.\n\nLet's denote them:\n\nFact #1: born date -> Who's -> first earliest.\nInterpretation: The phrase \"born date\" has relationship \"Who's\" to \"first earliest\". But the notation \"(Who 's)\" is probably intended to say \"who is\", but it's weird. It might be interpreted as \"the born date is the who's first earliest\"? Not sure.\n\nMaybe we interpret it as: \"Who’s\" can be read as \"whose\" or \"who is\"? Actually, it's ambiguous because there's a missing apostrophe? Possibly intended as \"born date -> (Who's) -> first earliest\", maybe meaning: \"born date is the first earliest whose ...\" hmm.\n\nWait, let me check again: There's a possibility that \"Who 's\" means \"who is\", but then the object \"first earliest\" doesn't make sense. Alternatively, \"Who 's\" might mean \"born date's\" i.e., possessive? Or \"born date\" is the subject of the relation \"Who’s\", which is a contraction for \"who is\" or \"whose\".\n\nI suspect that the relation \"Who 's\" is intended to indicate something like \"born date's\" property. However, the instructions require us to use all facts exactly as they appear, so we must include the piece \"Who 's\" exactly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a mistake in the prompt formatting? But I'll assume that the relation stands as provided. The relation \"Who 's\" could be replaced by \"whose\" if that makes more sense. Let me see how other relations look:\n\n\"born date -> (of) -> David Bowie,\" \"born date -> (of) -> Johnny Depp,\" \"born date -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong.\" So born date is associated with three people: David Bowie, Johnny Depp, Neil Armstrong. Then next, \"Neil Armstrong -> (attend) -> Purdue University,\" so Neil Armstrong attended Purdue University; \"Neil Armstrong -> (later earn) -> degree,\" so he earned a degree later; \"Neil Armstrong -> (involved in) -> controversies,\" so he was involved in controversies.\n\nThen \"What -> (is) -> born date,\" so what is born date? That might be asking: \"What is born date?\" And then \"What -> (were) -> public's expectations,\" so what were public's expectations? Then \"public's expectations -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong,\" so public's expectations were of Neil Armstrong; \"public's expectations -> (after) -> Apollo 11 mission,\" so after the Apollo 11 mission, public's expectations... oh wait, \"public's expectations\" is related to \"of Neil Armstrong\" and also \"after Apollo 11 mission.\" Possibly meaning that after the Apollo 11 mission, public's expectations regarding Neil Armstrong changed?\n\nThen \"Purdue University -> (on) -> naval scholarship,\" so Purdue University was on naval scholarship. Wait, \"on\" usually means \"was offered on\" or \"with\", but here it's \"Purdue University -> (on) -> naval scholarship\" which implies that Purdue University had something to do with naval scholarships. Perhaps Neil Armstrong attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship.\n\nNext, \"degree -> (in) -> aeronautical engineering,\" so his degree was in aeronautical engineering.\n\nFinally, \"controversies -> (such as) -> criticism,\" so controversies included criticism. And \"criticism -> (he faced for his) -> perceived aloofness.\" So he faced criticism for his perceived aloofness.\n\nSo overall, we have a network of information about Neil Armstrong and others. Also note that the facts mention David Bowie and Johnny Depp as having a \"born date\" connection. But then the fact \"born date -> (Who 's) -> first earliest\" seems odd. Could be misinterpreted: \"born date\" might refer to \"birthdates\", and then \"Who's\" may be a relation indicating that the birth dates of David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong are the earliest? But then \"first earliest\" does not match: It says \"first earliest\" which is redundant. Possibly it's trying to say that among those individuals, Neil Armstrong's birth date is the earliest? But then fact \"born date -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong\" appears separately. But then why would there be three \"of\" relations: \"born date -> (of) -> David Bowie\", \"born date -> (of) -> Johnny Depp\", \"born date -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong\"?\n\nMaybe the idea is that \"born date\" is a common concept applied to all three persons, but then the relation \"Who 's\" indicates that someone's \"first earliest\" is determined by their birth date. Unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the list is simply a random set of facts that don't necessarily connect logically. But our instruction is: \"Generate one complete English sentence that: - Uses all the information only in the facts - Includes no information not found in the facts\". So we need to craft a sentence that somehow mentions all the elements. We need to include all subjects and objects.\n\nLet's list all unique entities that appear in facts:\n\nSubjects:\n- born date\n- David Bowie\n- Johnny Depp\n- Neil Armstrong\n- Purdue University\n- degree\n- public's expectations\n- Apollo 11 mission\n- Naval scholarship (maybe implied from Purdue University)\n- aeronautical engineering\n- controversies\n- criticism\n- perceived aloofness\n\nAlso, \"What\" appears as subject in two facts (\"What -> (is) -> born date\" and \"What -> (were) -> public's expectations\"). But \"What\" is used as a placeholder for questions: \"what is born date\" and \"what were public's expectations\".\n\nThe facts are essentially a bunch of statements. We need to combine them in a coherent sentence. How can we combine them? One approach: Create a complex sentence that lists all the facts sequentially. But we must ensure that the sentence is grammatically coherent and uses all the information exactly as given.\n\nWe want one sentence that states: \n\nDavid Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong share the same born date, which is the first earliest [or something]. Neil Armstrong attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earning a degree in aeronautical engineering, and he was involved in controversies such as criticism for his perceived aloofness; meanwhile, public's expectations of him after the Apollo 11 mission were such-and-such, and moreover, what is born date and what were public's expectations? Hmm, but we cannot add extra words not in the facts.\n\nBut the instruction \"Includes no information not found in the facts\" means we can't introduce anything beyond these specific phrases. So we have to literally use the exact strings: \"born date\", \"first earliest\", \"of\", \"attend\", \"later earn\", \"involved in\", \"on\", \"in\", \"such as\", \"he faced for his\", etc. \n\nMaybe we can construct a sentence that enumerates: \"David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong's born date is the first earliest, while Neil Armstrong attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earning a degree in aeronautical engineering, and was involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloofness; furthermore, what is born date and what were public's expectations of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission?\" But then that introduces the word \"furthermore\", which is not explicitly in the facts.\n\nWe need to use only the given words as they appear in the facts. But we can use connecting words like \"and\" if needed? The instruction \"includes no information not found in the facts\" means that every piece of content must come directly from the facts. But we are allowed to add linking words if they are generic connectors. The safe assumption is that we can use basic conjunctions like \"and\", \"while\", \"but\", \"as\", \"for\", etc. But maybe not. The instruction says \"includes no information not found in the facts\", meaning we cannot add any extraneous details. But the connectors themselves are not part of the facts, so careful.\n\nMaybe we can simply string them together with commas and semicolons. But then we might lose clarity.\n\nAlternatively, we can create a sentence that is structured as follows:\n\n\"Born date, which is first earliest, is of David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong; Neil Armstrong attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earning a degree in aeronautical engineering, and was involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloofness, while public's expectations of him after the Apollo 11 mission were what they were, and what is born date?\" But then we have repetition of \"what\" at beginning.\n\nPerhaps we can use relative clauses to incorporate the \"What\" facts. For example: \"What is born date\" becomes \"the born date is ...\", and \"What were public's expectations\" becomes \"public's expectations were ...\". But we have to be careful.\n\nLet's try to reorder the facts logically:\n\nThere are two groups: one group concerning \"born date\" and its associations, and another concerning Neil Armstrong's biography and public's expectations.\n\nGroup 1: Born date facts:\n- born date -> (Who 's) -> first earliest,\n- born date -> (of) -> David Bowie,\n- born date -> (of) -> Johnny Depp,\n- born date -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong,\n- What -> (is) -> born date.\n\nThis group seems to be about \"born date\": \"What is born date?\" Answer: \"first earliest\", and it is of David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong. But that doesn't sound right. Maybe \"first earliest\" is a descriptor of \"born date\"? It might be \"the first earliest born date\" but then \"of David Bowie, Johnny Depp, Neil Armstrong\" means that they share the same birth date? But if they share the same birth date, then that is impossible unless it's a coincidence. But anyway, we must include it.\n\nGroup 2: Neil Armstrong's biography:\n- Neil Armstrong -> (attend) -> Purdue University,\n- Neil Armstrong -> (later earn) -> degree,\n- Neil Armstrong -> (involved in) -> controversies,\n- Purdue University -> (on) -> naval scholarship,\n- degree -> (in) -> aeronautical engineering,\n- controversies -> (such as) -> criticism,\n- criticism -> (he faced for his) -> perceived aloofness.\n\nGroup 3: Public's expectations:\n- What -> (were) -> public's expectations,\n- public's expectations -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong,\n- public's expectations -> (after) -> Apollo 11 mission.\n\nNow, how to integrate them into one sentence? We need a sentence that covers everything.\n\nOne possible approach: Start with a clause about born date, then a comma, then a clause about Neil Armstrong's education and career, then a clause about controversies, and then a clause about public's expectations. But then \"What is born date?\" and \"What were public's expectations?\" are questions. But we need to answer them with the given facts. Possibly, the sentence can be constructed as:\n\n\"Born date, which is first earliest and is of David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong, is the subject of inquiry, as is public's expectations, which were of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission; Neil Armstrong attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earning a degree in aeronautical engineering, and was involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloofness.\"\n\nThat sentence uses many of the facts. But does it include \"What\" parts? Not yet. We need to include \"What -> (is) -> born date\" and \"What -> (were) -> public's expectations\". Perhaps we can modify it to: \"What is born date? It is first earliest and is of David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong; moreover, what were public's expectations? They were of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission; furthermore, Neil Armstrong attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earning a degree in aeronautical engineering, and was involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloofness.\" But then we get two sentences separated by semicolons, but the instruction said \"one complete English sentence\". We can join them with semicolons or commas.\n\nBut \"What\" itself appears as a subject in the facts, so we might need to incorporate the phrase \"What is born date\" and \"What were public's expectations\" in the sentence. But if I put them in the sentence as subordinate clauses, it might become awkward. Alternatively, I can embed them as questions within a larger statement: \"Inquiring minds asked, 'What is born date?' and received the answer that it is first earliest and is of David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong; similarly, when asked, 'What were public's expectations?' the reply was that they were of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission, and indeed, Neil Armstrong attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earning a degree in aeronautical engineering, and was involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloofness.\"\n\nHowever, that introduces extra words like \"inquiring minds asked\" which might be considered extra info not in the facts. The instruction \"includes no information not found in the facts\" means we cannot add extraneous narrative like \"inquiring minds asked\". Instead, we must just state the facts.\n\nAlternatively, we can structure the sentence as a list: \"Born date, which is first earliest and is of David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong, and what is born date? Neil Armstrong attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earning a degree in aeronautical engineering, was involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloofness, and public's expectations, which were of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission, remained what they were.\" But then we're repeating \"what\" unnecessarily.\n\nMaybe we can use relative clauses: \"David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong share a born date—that is, the first earliest—which is defined by the query 'What is born date?' Meanwhile, Neil Armstrong, who attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earned a degree in aeronautical engineering and was involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloofness; concurrently, public's expectations—those that were of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission—are encapsulated by the query 'What were public's expectations?'\" But then the sentence ends with a question mark? But it must be a complete sentence without question marks if we follow instructions? The instructions do not specify punctuation style, but likely we want one declarative sentence.\n\nAlternatively, we can write: \"David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong share the same born date—the first earliest—which is the subject of the query 'What is born date?'; Neil Armstrong, who attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earned a degree in aeronautical engineering and was involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloofness, became the focus of public's expectations—those being what they were of him after the Apollo 11 mission, as captured by the inquiry 'What were public's expectations?'\" But then we have two queries inside the sentence, which might be acceptable as long as they are taken verbatim from the facts.\n\nBut the instruction says \"uses all the information only in the facts\", so we must include the segments \"What is born date\" and \"What were public's expectations\" exactly. But then we have the issue that \"What\" is a subject in the facts. But maybe we can treat them as embedded interrogatives that are answered by the rest of the sentence.\n\nAlternatively, we can start the sentence with \"What is born date?\" and then answer it, and then continue with a comma and \"What were public's expectations?\" But then the sentence will contain two independent questions, which is not ideal. But perhaps we can integrate them as subordinate clauses.\n\nOr maybe we can arrange the sentence as: \"The born date, which is first earliest and of David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong, answers the query 'What is born date?', while Neil Armstrong, who attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earned a degree in aeronautical engineering and was involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloofness, was the subject of public's expectations—those being what they were of him after the Apollo 11 mission, answering the query 'What were public's expectations?'\" But then we have two queries. But then the entire sentence is extremely long and convoluted.\n\nWe must incorporate all pieces. Let me list them clearly:\n\nSegment A: Born date segment:\n- \"born date\" is described by relation: \"Who 's\" gives \"first earliest\".\n- Additionally, \"born date\" is \"of\" David Bowie, Johnny Depp, Neil Armstrong.\n- And there's a query: \"What -> (is) -> born date\" which means \"What is born date?\"\n\nSo effectively, the answer to \"What is born date?\" is \"first earliest\" and it pertains to David Bowie, Johnny Depp, Neil Armstrong. But the fact \"born date -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong\" already exists separately, so maybe it's redundant. But we must include both \"of\" relations for Bowie, Depp, Armstrong. So the sentence should mention that David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong share the same born date.\n\nSegment B: Neil Armstrong's biography:\n- Neil Armstrong attended Purdue University.\n- He did so on a naval scholarship (from fact: Purdue University -> (on) -> naval scholarship).\n- Later he earned a degree.\n- His degree was in aeronautical engineering.\n- He was involved in controversies.\n- Controversies include criticism.\n- Criticism he faced was for his perceived aloofness.\n\nSegment C: Public's expectations:\n- Query: \"What -> (were) -> public's expectations\"\n- And \"public's expectations -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong\" (so they were of Neil Armstrong).\n- And \"public's expectations -> (after) -> Apollo 11 mission\" (so after Apollo 11 mission).\n\nWe need to incorporate that too.\n\nA possible unified sentence might be:\n\n\"David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong share the same born date—which is first earliest—and thus answer the question 'What is born date?'; Neil Armstrong, who attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earned a degree in aeronautical engineering and was involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloofness, thereby embodying public's expectations of him after the Apollo 11 mission, which were what they were.\"\n\nBut now I'm using \"embodied\" and \"thereby\" which are not in the facts. We must avoid adding any new words that aren't in the facts. But we can use simple connectors like \"and\", \"which\", \"that\", etc. But I worry that \"embodied\" might be seen as extra interpretation. The instruction says \"includes no information not found in the facts\", so we must not add interpretations that aren't stated. However, we can say \"and public's expectations were of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission\" exactly.\n\nMaybe we can simply list them in order: \"David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong share the same born date, which is first earliest and of them; Neil Armstrong attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earning a degree in aeronautical engineering, and was involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloofness; and public's expectations of him after the Apollo 11 mission were what they were.\" But then we haven't incorporated \"What is born date?\" and \"What were public's expectations?\" exactly.\n\nAlternatively, we can incorporate those queries as embedded clauses: \"What is born date?\" might be rephrased as \"the born date is\" something. But the fact is \"What -> (is) -> born date\", so maybe we can insert \"born date\" as the answer to \"What is born date?\" But that doesn't work logically.\n\nAlternatively, we can incorporate the queries as: \"What is born date? It is first earliest and of David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong.\" But then we have two sentences. But the instruction asks for one complete English sentence.\n\nMaybe we can use semicolons to separate distinct parts while still making one sentence. For instance:\n\n\"What is born date? First earliest and of David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong; Neil Armstrong attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earning a degree in aeronautical engineering, and was involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloofness; and what were public's expectations? Those of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission.\"\n\nBut then that is two questions embedded in one sentence. But then we are including the queries exactly: \"What is born date?\" and \"What were public's expectations?\" But then the sentence becomes disjointed.\n\nMaybe we can rephrase the queries as statements: \"The born date is first earliest and of David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong\" and \"Public's expectations were of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission.\" But then we lose the \"What\" words. But the instruction says \"Uses all the information only in the facts\". Does that mean we must include the exact fragments \"What is born date\" and \"What were public's expectations\" or can we paraphrase them? The instruction says \"include no information not found in the facts\", but doesn't necessarily require preserving the original phrasing. However, maybe it does require using all the information that is in the facts. The query \"What -> (is) -> born date\" is information that should be represented in the sentence, even though it's phrased as a question. Similarly, \"What -> (were) -> public's expectations\" is information.\n\nGiven that, I think it's best to include them as embedded questions: \"What is born date?\" and \"What were public's expectations?\" But then how do we incorporate them in one sentence? Possibly by saying: \"David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong share the same born date—the answer to 'What is born date?'—which is first earliest; Neil Armstrong attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earning a degree in aeronautical engineering, and was involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloofness; concurrently, public's expectations—those addressed by the question 'What were public's expectations?'—were of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission.\" That sentence might be acceptable. But it's very long and might be too complicated.\n\nLet's try to simplify: We want one sentence that uses all the information. We have three main topics: Born Date, Neil Armstrong's biography, and Public's Expectations.\n\nWe can structure it as: \"David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong share the same born date—that is, the first earliest—which is what is born date; Neil Armstrong, who attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earned a degree in aeronautical engineering and was involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloofness; and public's expectations—namely, what were public's expectations—were of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission.\" But then \"namely\" is extra wording.\n\nWe must be cautious not to add any words not in the facts. Allowed connectors: \"and\", \"of\", \"later earn\", \"involved in\", \"such as\", \"faced for his\", \"attended\", \"earned\", \"on\", \"in\", \"what\", \"is\", \"were\", etc. But words like \"share\", \"same\", \"thus\", \"concurrently\" are not in the facts. But maybe we can use them as they are standard connectors? The instruction says \"includes no information not found in the facts\", which might imply that every descriptive element must come from the facts. But I think we are allowed to add minimal linking words that are not in the facts, as long as they don't add new factual content.\n\nHowever, to be safe, I might try to limit myself to the vocabulary that appears in the facts. Let's list the vocabulary from the facts: \n- born date, first earliest, David Bowie, Johnny Depp, Neil Armstrong, attend, Purdue University, later earn, degree, involved in, controversies, What, is, were, public's expectations, of, after, Apollo 11 mission, on, naval scholarship, in, aeronautical engineering, such as, criticism, he faced for his, perceived aloofness.\n\nWe can use \"and\" because it's a natural connector. We can use \"whom\" maybe? But maybe not.\n\nI want to preserve the structure of each triple: subject -> relation -> object. We want to incorporate each triple exactly once in some manner. Possibly we can list them in a sentence separated by semicolons.\n\nFor example, consider writing:\n\"David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong's born date is first earliest and of them; Neil Armstrong attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earned a degree in aeronautical engineering, and was involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloofness; and public's expectations were of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission.\"\nAnd then append: \"What is born date?\" and \"What were public's expectations?\" But then that repeats things.\n\nAlternatively, I can embed the questions as subordinate clauses:\n\"David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong's born date—the answer to 'What is born date?'—is first earliest and of them; Neil Armstrong attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earned a degree in aeronautical engineering, and was involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloofness; and public's expectations—the answer to 'What were public's expectations?'—were of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission.\"\nThat looks neat, but I'm not entirely comfortable with the phrase \"the answer to 'What is born date?'\" because that might be seen as adding extra commentary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can simply state: \"David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong's born date is first earliest and of them; Neil Armstrong attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earned a degree in aeronautical engineering, and was involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloostness; and public's expectations were of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission.\"\nBut then I've omitted the queries \"What is born date?\" and \"What were public's expectations?\" which are part of the facts. But maybe it's okay if we incorporate them implicitly? The instruction says \"uses all the information only in the facts\" meaning every fact must be represented. So we must represent the fact \"What -> (is) -> born date\" somewhere in the sentence. That fact is essentially a question: \"What is born date?\" It expects an answer \"born date\" is something? But the answer given in the fact is \"born date\" equals \"born date\"? No, wait, the fact is \"What -> (is) -> born date\". It might be interpreted as \"What is born date?\" and the expected answer is \"born date\", but that doesn't add information. Alternatively, maybe it's meant to be read as \"born date is what?\" I'm confused.\n\nMaybe the intention is that the fact \"What -> (is) -> born date\" is a statement that defines \"born date\". So maybe we should incorporate it as: \"born date is born date\", but that is trivial. Possibly it's a mistake in the facts. However, I must incorporate it somehow.\n\nSimilarly, \"What -> (were) -> public's expectations\" is a fact that defines public's expectations. But the answer is \"public's expectations\". That doesn't add content either.\n\nIt might be that the facts are intentionally incomplete or nonsensical. However, I must produce a sentence that uses all these fragments in a coherent way.\n\nI wonder if we can treat the \"What\" parts as labels for the subjects. For instance: \"What is born date?\" might be rephrased as \"The born date, which is first earliest and of David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong, is...\" But then the phrase \"What is born date?\" is lost.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can incorporate them as appositives: \"born date, which is what is born date, is first earliest and of David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong\" but that sounds redundant.\n\nMaybe we can simply ignore the \"What\" parts since they are not adding new information? But the instruction says \"use all the information\".\n\nI must include them. I can include them as parenthetical clarifications: \"born date (i.e., what is born date)\" but then I'm inserting \"i.e.\" which is not in the facts.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the exact phrasing: \"What is born date\" must appear in the sentence. I could do something like: \"David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong share the same born date, which is first earliest and of them, and that is what is born date;\" then continue with the rest.\n\nBut then \"what is born date\" is repeated twice if I also mention \"born date\" earlier.\n\nMaybe I can incorporate it as: \"David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong share the same born date—the first earliest, which is what is born date—and Neil Armstrong attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earning a degree in aeronautical engineering, and was involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloostness; meanwhile, public's expectations, which were of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission, constitute what were public's expectations.\" But then the sentence ends with a fragment.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can structure it as: \"David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong share the same born date—the first earliest, which is what is born date—and Neil Armstrong attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earning a degree in aeronautical engineering, and was involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloostness; and public's expectations, namely what were public's expectations, were of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission.\" That might be acceptable.\n\nWe need to check if we used all facts:\n- \"born date -> (Who 's) -> first earliest\" is used as \"the first earliest\".\n- \"born date -> (of) -> David Bowie\" is used as \"of David Bowie\".\n- \"born date -> (of) -> Johnny Depp\" is used as \"of Johnny Depp\".\n- \"born date -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong\" is used as \"of Neil Armstrong\" (though Neil Armstrong already mentioned later, but it's fine).\n- \"Neil Armstrong -> (attend) -> Purdue University\" is used as \"attended Purdue University\".\n- \"Neil Armstrong -> (later earn) -> degree\" is used as \"later earning a degree\".\n- \"Neil Armstrong -> (involved in) -> controversies\" is used as \"was involved in controversies\".\n- \"Purdue University -> (on) -> naval scholarship\" is used as \"on a naval scholarship\".\n- \"degree -> (in) -> aeronautical engineering\" is used as \"a degree in aeronautical engineering\".\n- \"controversies -> (such as) -> criticism\" is used as \"such as criticism\".\n- \"criticism -> (he faced for his) -> perceived aloostness\" is used as \"criticism he faced for his perceived aloostness\".\n- \"What -> (is) -> born date\" is used as \"what is born date\" inserted in the sentence.\n- \"What -> (were) -> public's expectations\" is used as \"what were public's expectations\" inserted in the sentence.\n- \"public's expectations -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong\" is used as \"were of Neil Armstrong\".\n- \"public's expectations -> (after) -> Apollo 11 mission\" is used as \"after the Apollo 11 mission\".\n\nYes, all are present.\n\nWe must check grammar carefully.\n\nLet's try to compose a sentence:\n\n\"David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong share the same born date—the first earliest, which is what is born date—and Neil Armstrong, who attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earned a degree in aeronautical engineering and was involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloostness; meanwhile, public's expectations—namely, what were public's expectations—were of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission.\"\n\nI worry about the use of \"alostness\" vs \"aloofness\". I must double-check: the fact says \"perceived aloostness\" but actually text says \"perceived aloostness\" or \"perceived aloofness\"? The fact line is \"criticism -> (he faced for his) -> perceived aloostness\". Wait, I need to check the original text: \"criticism -> (he faced for his) -> perceived aloostness\". It might be \"aloofness\" but typed incorrectly. I'll assume it's \"aloofness\" as intended. But the fact exactly says \"perceived aloostness\", but that might be a typo. I'll assume \"aloofness\" is intended. But instructions say \"only in the facts\", so I must output exactly what is in the facts. The fact says \"perceived aloostness\". I'll keep it as \"perceived aloostness\" even though it seems off. But maybe I'll adjust to \"perceived aloofness\" because it's the common word. But instructions say \"no information not found in the facts\", so I must not change the words. But \"aloostness\" is not a real word. But maybe I'll leave it as \"perceived aloostness\" because that's exactly what's given. But then the sentence will read \"criticism he faced for his perceived aloostness\", which is weird. However, instructions say \"Include no information not found in the facts\", so I should not fix typos? But maybe I can assume it's \"perceived aloofness\" because the fact \"Who 's\" might be a typo as well. But I'll stick to the exact spelling: \"perceived aloostness\".\n\nThough, \"Who 's\" is also weird. It has an extra space between W and h? It might be \"Whose\". I suspect it's supposed to be \"born date -> (Whose) -> first earliest\". If I consider that, then \"Whose born date is first earliest\" might be reworded as \"the born date belongs to David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong\". But I'll assume it's \"Who 's\" as given.\n\nI can try to use it as \"Which is what is born date\" but that doesn't parse.\n\nMaybe I can rephrase: \"David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong share the same born date, which is first earliest and of them, and that is what is born date;\" But then I've inserted \"what is born date\" in the middle. I'll try to incorporate it seamlessly.\n\nI worry about punctuation. I can use semicolons to separate major parts.\n\nAlternative attempt:\n\n\"David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong share the same born date—the first earliest, which is what is born date—and Neil Armstrong attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earning a degree in aeronautical engineering and becoming involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloostness; moreover, public's expectations, namely what were public's expectations, were of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission.\"\n\nThat might be acceptable.\n\nI want to check if I've used every piece:\n\n- \"born date\" appears.\n- \"first earliest\" appears.\n- \"of David Bowie\" appears.\n- \"of Johnny Depp\" appears.\n- \"of Neil Armstrong\" appears.\n- \"attend Purdue University\" appears.\n- \"later earn degree\" appears.\n- \"involved in controversies\" appears.\n- \"naval scholarship\" appears.\n- \"degree in aeronautical engineering\" appears.\n- \"such as criticism\" appears.\n- \"he faced for his perceived aloostness\" appears.\n- \"What is born date\" appears as \"which is what is born date\"\n- \"What were public's expectations\" appears as \"namely, what were public's expectations\"\n- \"of Neil Armstrong\" appears.\n- \"after Apollo 11 mission\" appears.\n\nYes, all are there.\n\nHowever, I'm concerned about the flow. The sentence might be extremely long. But the instruction says \"Generate one complete English sentence\" - it doesn't require brevity, just correctness.\n\nI can try to reorganize slightly for clarity:\n\n\"David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong share the same born date—the first earliest, which is what is born date—and Neil Armstrong attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earning a degree in aeronautical engineering and becoming involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloostness; additionally, public's expectations—namely, what were public's expectations—were of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission.\"\n\nThis seems to capture all the data.\n\nI worry about the phrase \"becoming involved\" versus \"was involved\". The fact says \"Neil Armstrong -> (involved in) -> controversies\", so \"was involved in controversies\" is better.\n\nI can say \"and was involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloostness\". That is clearer.\n\nMaybe I'll remove \"becoming\" to maintain tense consistency.\n\nThus: \"... Neil Armstrong attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earning a degree in aeronautical engineering and was involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloostness;\" That works.\n\nMaybe I'll also mention the \"after Apollo 11 mission\" part near the end: \"public's expectations—namely, what were public's expectations—were of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission.\" That is clear.\n\nI can also mention the \"of\" relations: \"born date is of David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong\" - I already did that.\n\nI might want to insert the \"of\" explicitly: \"David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong's born date is first earliest and of them\" but that might be too repetitive. I already mentioned \"share the same born date\" which implies that.\n\nI worry that the phrase \"which is what is born date\" is awkward. Perhaps I can rework that portion: Instead of \"the first earliest, which is what is born date\", I can say \"the first earliest born date\"—but then I am modifying \"born date\" with an adjective \"first earliest\", which is not standard. Alternatively, I can say \"the first earliest born date—that is, what is born date—\" But then it's not smoother.\n\nMaybe I can say: \"David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong share the same born date—the first earliest, which is defined by what is born date—and Neil Armstrong attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earning a degree in aeronautical engineering and was involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloostness; further, public's expectations—specifically, what were public's expectations—were of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission.\" But \"defined by what is born date\" might be forced.\n\nAlternatively, I can simply drop the insertion \"which is what is born date\" and instead say \"the born date, which is first earliest\" and then separately mention \"What is born date?\" But then I'm not using that fact.\n\nMaybe I can incorporate it as a parenthetical: \"David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong share the same born date (i.e., the first earliest, which is what is born date)\" but then \"i.e.\" is extra.\n\nThe instructions say \"includes no information not found in the facts\", so maybe I shouldn't add \"i.e.\".\n\nI might try: \"David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong share the same born date—the first earliest, which is what is born date—and Neil Armstrong attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earning a degree in aeronautical engineering and was involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloostness; moreover, public's expectations—namely, what were public's expectations—were of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission.\" That is my candidate sentence.\n\nI worry about the phrase \"namely, what were public's expectations\" might be improved to \"namely, what were public's expectations\" is exactly what is in the fact \"What -> (were) -> public's expectations\". But then \"namely\" is extra. But I can remove \"namely\" and just say \"public's expectations—what were public's expectations—were of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission.\" That might be even better.\n\nSo final version: \"David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong share the same born date—the first earliest, which is what is born date—and Neil Armstrong attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earning a degree in aeronautical engineering and was involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloostness; furthermore, public's expectations—what were public's expectations—were of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission.\"\n\nThat seems to cover all. I'll check each fact mapping:\n- Fact 1: \"born date -> (Who 's) -> first earliest\" becomes \"the same born date—the first earliest\" (we lost \"Who 's\" but we assume it's implicit). We haven't explicitly used \"Who 's\" but we've used \"first earliest\" which is the object of that relation. The relation \"Who 's\" might be interpreted as \"belongs to\" but I'm not sure.\n- Fact 2: \"born date -> (of) -> David Bowie\" is covered by \"David Bowie\" in the list.\n- Fact 3: \"born date -> (of) -> Johnny Depp\" is covered.\n- Fact 4: \"born date -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong\" is covered.\n- Fact 5: \"Neil Armstrong -> (attend) -> Purdue University\" is covered by \"Neil Armstrong attended Purdue University\".\n- Fact 6: \"Neil Armstrong -> (later earn) -> degree\" is covered by \"later earning a degree\".\n- Fact 7: \"Neil Armstrong -> (involved in) -> controversies\" is covered by \"was involved in controversies\".\n- Fact 8: \"What -> (is) -> born date\" is covered by \"which is what is born date\".\n- Fact 9: \"What -> (were) -> public's expectations\" is covered by \"what were public's expectations\".\n- Fact 10: \"public's expectations -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong\" is covered by \"were of Neil Armstrong\".\n- Fact 11: \"public's expectations -> (after) -> Apollo 11 mission\" is covered by \"after the Apollo 11 mission\".\n- Fact 12: \"Purdue University -> (on) -> naval scholarship\" is covered by \"on a naval scholarship\".\n- Fact 13: \"degree -> (in) -> aeronautical engineering\" is covered by \"degree in aeronautical engineering\".\n- Fact 14: \"controversies -> (such as) -> criticism\" is covered by \"controversies such as criticism\".\n- Fact 15: \"criticism -> (he faced for his) -> perceived aloostness\" is covered by \"criticism he faced for his perceived aloostness\".\n\nYes, all are included.\n\nI worry about the use of \"furthermore\" vs \"moreover\" vs \"additionally\". The fact \"Neil Armstrong -> (involved in) -> controversies\" is past tense, so \"was involved\" is appropriate. I'll stick with \"and was involved\".\n\nI worry about the pronoun \"his\" referring to Neil Armstrong. That's correct.\n\nI worry about the phrase \"share the same born date\" implying they are born on the same day, but the fact \"born date -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong\" is separate, but it's fine.\n\nI worry about the phrase \"first earliest\" which is strange wording. But it's given.\n\nI worry about the phrase \"public's expectations — what were public's expectations\" is a bit awkward. I might rephrase as \"public's expectations—what were public's expectations—were of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission.\" That is a bit clunky but required.\n\nI might try to smooth it out: \"and public's expectations—namely, what were public's expectations—were of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission.\" But then \"namely\" is extra. Without \"namely\", it reads \"public's expectations—what were public's expectations—were of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission.\" That is a bit unusual. Perhaps I can restructure: \"and the public's expectations, which were what were public's expectations, were of Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission.\" That might be clearer.\n\nLet's try: \"David Bowie, Johnny Depp, and Neil Armstrong share the same born date—the first earliest, which is what is born date—and Neil Armstrong attended Purdue University on a naval scholarship, later earning a degree in aeronautical engineering and was involved in controversies such as criticism he faced for his perceived aloostness; furthermore, the public's expectations—which were what"

        "<think>We have been asked \"You are given A list of facts in the form: subject -> relation -> object, subject->relation->object,...\". We must generate one complete English sentence that uses all the information only in the facts. It says \"Includes no information not found in the facts\" and we want output: a single English sentence.\n\nGiven facts:\n\nFacts:\n1. born date -> (Who 's) -> first earliest,\n2. born date -> (of) -> Lionel Messi,\n3. born date -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong,\n4. born date -> (of) -> Vincent van Gogh,\n5. Neil Armstrong -> (face) -> controversies,\n6. Neil Armstrong -> (born to) -> family,\n7. Neil Armstrong -> (relation) -> mother,\n8. What -> (is) -> born date,\n9. What -> (was) -> public's perception,\n10. public's perception -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong's achievements,\n11. controversies -> (regarding his) -> portrayal,\n12. mother -> (was) -> homemaker,\n13. portrayal -> (as) -> hero.\n\nLet's check them carefully:\n\nI'll rewrite each with consistent punctuation and grammar:\n\nFact 1: \"born date -> (Who 's) -> first earliest,\" I'm reading \"born date -> Who’s first earliest\"? But it might be \"born date\" is the subject, relation is \"Who's\", object is \"first earliest.\" That seems odd: maybe it means \"born date is the first earliest who?\" Actually re-read: \"born date -> (Who 's) -> first earliest,\" Perhaps intended meaning is \"Who's born date is the first earliest?\" Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, \"born date\" might be a concept or phrase? Possibly \"born date\" is a noun phrase that stands for something like \"the date someone was born\" but then \"Who's\" seems like contraction of \"who is\" but not exactly. Let me consider possibility: Fact 1: \"born date -> (Who 's) -> first earliest,\" might be read as: \"born date is the first earliest [something]\" but this doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe the idea is: \"born date\" is related to \"first earliest\", but then later \"born date\" appears again with relation \"(of)\" with Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, Vincent van Gogh. So \"born date\" is used as a kind of property that has several objects (like people). And also there's \"What -> (is) -> born date\" which suggests a question: \"What is born date?\" but then answer \"born date\" is not clear.\n\nWait, let me parse the facts:\n\nThe structure is: subject -> relation -> object. The subjects can be phrases, relations are in parentheses, objects are phrases or names. They seem to come in groups, possibly representing different aspects of a narrative about birthdates and controversies, etc.\n\nLet's check grouping: There is group around \"born date\": Fact 1: \"born date -> (Who 's) -> first earliest,\" Fact 2: \"born date -> (of) -> Lionel Messi,\" Fact 3: \"born date -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong,\" Fact 4: \"born date -> (of) -> Vincent van Gogh,\" Fact 8: \"What -> (is) -> born date\".\n\nSo these facts refer to \"born date\" being associated with Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, Vincent van Gogh, and also some notion of \"first earliest\" and \"what is born date\".\n\nThen there is group around Neil Armstrong: Fact 5: \"Neil Armstrong -> (face) -> controversies,\" Fact 6: \"Neil Armstrong -> (born to) -> family,\" Fact 7: \"Neil Armstrong -> (relation) -> mother,\" Fact 10: \"public's perception -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong's achievements,\" Fact 11: \"controversies -> (regarding his) -> portrayal,\" Fact 13: \"portrayal -> (as) -> hero.\" Then Fact 9: \"What -> (was) -> public's perception,\" so that relates to what was the public's perception.\n\nAnd then there is fact 12: \"mother -> (was) -> homemaker.\"\n\nNow we need to produce a sentence that includes all pieces. The sentence should incorporate all the information, but nothing extra. The sentence must be complete English sentence, using all facts, only the ones provided.\n\nWe need to use every piece. The instructions say \"Use all the information only in the facts; includes no information not found in the facts.\" So our sentence must mention: \"born date\" things, \"first earliest\", \"Lionel Messi\", \"Neil Armstrong\", \"Vincent van Gogh\", \"Neil Armstrong face controversies\", \"Neil Armstrong born to family\", \"Neil Armstrong relation mother\", \"What is born date\", \"What was public's perception\", \"public's perception of Neil Armstrong's achievements\", \"controversies regarding his portrayal\", \"mother was homemaker\", \"portrayal as hero\".\n\nWe must combine these facts coherently in one sentence.\n\nIt may be tricky because some facts might conflict. For example, \"born date\" is described as \"first earliest\" in fact 1, while also having relationships of \"of\" Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, Vincent van Gogh. Also fact 8: \"What is born date\" is ambiguous.\n\nAlso fact 5: \"Neil Armstrong faced controversies\" and fact 11: \"Controversies regarding his portrayal\" so controversies relate to his portrayal. Then fact 13: \"Portrayal as hero\" so his portrayal is as hero. Meanwhile fact 10: \"Public's perception of Neil Armstrong's achievements\" and fact 9: \"What was public's perception\" (which asks what was public's perception) though unclear.\n\nAdditionally, fact 6: \"Neil Armstrong born to family\" and fact 7: \"Neil Armstrong relation mother\" and fact 12: \"Mother was homemaker.\" So his mother was homemaker. \n\nPerhaps we can generate a sentence along the lines of: \"Born date is the first earliest record of birth among Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh, where Neil Armstrong, who was born to a family with a homemaker mother, faced controversies regarding his portrayal as a hero, despite public perception of his achievements.\" But wait, that would include extra words \"despite public perception\" but the facts do not provide \"despite\" wording. But we can try to incorporate them logically.\n\nLet's attempt to produce a coherent sentence that mentions all the details. We need to include: \"born date\", \"first earliest\", \"Lionel Messi\", \"Neil Armstrong\", \"Vincent van Gogh\", \"faced controversies\", \"born to family\", \"relation mother\", \"public's perception\", \"of Neil Armstrong's achievements\", \"controversies regarding his portrayal\", \"mother was homemaker\", \"portrayal as hero\", \"What is born date\" and \"What was public's perception\" maybe as questions embedded? But likely we want to use declarative statements.\n\nWe want a single sentence that is complete.\n\nPossible approach: Start with \"What is born date?\" But then it must include all info. Alternatively, \"What was public's perception?\" But then how to incorporate the rest?\n\nPerhaps we can start with \"What is born date?\" and then continue describing it as follows: \"Born date, defined as the first earliest record, pertains to notable individuals including Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh; moreover, Neil Armstrong, whose birth came from a family led by a homemaker mother, faced controversies regarding his portrayal as a hero, even though the public's perception of his achievements remains in question.\" But careful: \"born date\" is a bit awkward phrasing if we use it as a question.\n\nHowever, note that fact 1: \"born date -> (Who 's) -> first earliest,\" perhaps implies that born date is \"who's\" first earliest? That is weird. Possibly the intended meaning is: \"Who's born date is the first earliest?\" Maybe it's a riddle: \"Who's born date is the first earliest?\" Could be \"What is born date?\" But fact 8 explicitly says \"What -> (is) -> born date\", so it might be asking \"What is born date?\" So maybe we treat it as a question: \"What is born date?\" but then we must incorporate that.\n\nBut if we put a question mark, then it's not a complete sentence that states everything. However, instructions said \"Generate one complete English sentence\", so maybe it should be a statement. But we cannot include extraneous information not in the facts.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a relative clause structure to include both \"What is born date\" and \"What was public's perception\". But they are questions.\n\nMaybe we can incorporate them as subordinate clauses: \"While it is known that born date is first earliest and that public's perception was of Neil Armstrong's achievements, Neil Armstrong, born to a family with a homemaker mother, faced controversies regarding his portrayal as a hero, alongside Lionel Messi and Vincent van Gogh.\" But then fact 1 becomes \"first earliest\" which is ambiguous.\n\nLet's re-read the facts carefully and try to decipher their possible intended meanings:\n\nFacts:\n(1) born date -> (Who 's) -> first earliest,\n(2) born date -> (of) -> Lionel Messi,\n(3) born date -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong,\n(4) born date -> (of) -> Vincent van Gogh,\n(5) Neil Armstrong -> (face) -> controversies,\n(6) Neil Armstrong -> (born to) -> family,\n(7) Neil Armstrong -> (relation) -> mother,\n(8) What -> (is) -> born date,\n(9) What -> (was) -> public's perception,\n(10) public's perception -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong's achievements,\n(11) controversies -> (regarding his) -> portrayal,\n(12) mother -> (was) -> homemaker,\n(13) portrayal -> (as) -> hero.\n\nInterpretation possibilities:\n- \"born date\" might be a concept referring to the dates of birth of certain famous figures. Fact 1: \"Who's first earliest\" might be interpreted as: \"Whose born date is the first earliest?\" That could mean that among those mentioned, the person with the earliest born date is unknown? But then fact 8 \"What is born date\" indicates a definition question.\n\n- Alternatively, \"born date\" might be considered as a common property: the date someone was born. And the facts tell us that Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh share that property? But then fact 1 \"Who's first earliest\" might indicate that out of these three, one is the earliest born, but it's not clear.\n\n- Next, Neil Armstrong is connected to controversies (\"faced controversies\"), he is born to a family, his relation is mother, and his mother was homemaker. Additionally, his portrayal is as a hero, but controversies regarding his portrayal exist. And public's perception was of Neil Armstrong's achievements. And also what was public's perception? Fact 9 \"What was public's perception\" might be answered by fact 10 \"public's perception of Neil Armstrong's achievements\". So his achievements were perceived publicly in a certain way.\n\n- So overall, we have a set of disjointed pieces of information about \"born date\" and \"Neil Armstrong\" and others.\n\nWe need to integrate them all into one sentence. The challenge is to maintain the exact phrases from the facts without adding extra words that are not found in the facts. But we have to transform them into a grammatically coherent sentence.\n\nOne strategy: Construct a sentence that lists multiple clauses separated by commas or semicolons. But must ensure that all elements appear exactly once.\n\nMaybe we can write: \"Who's born date is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh; and what is born date, while Neil Armstrong, born to family, whose relation is mother who was homemaker, faced controversies regarding his portrayal as a hero, even though what was public's perception was of Neil Armstrong's achievements.\" But we need to check if every fact is included:\n\nCheck each fact:\n\nFact 1: \"born date -> (Who 's) -> first earliest,\" -> Our sentence: \"Who's born date is first earliest\" appears in clause \"Who's born date is first earliest\".\nBut does that sound natural? Might be \"Whose born date is first earliest\" but then we already have \"first earliest\" in it. Possibly \"whose born date is the first earliest\" but then fact 1 is \"born date -> (Who 's)\" not \"whose\" but \"Who's\" is ambiguous. It might be a typographical error. But we must include the exact relationship words: \"Who's\" appears in fact 1. So I'll include \"Who's\" exactly.\n\nI must decide: Should I include the apostrophe s exactly as given? The fact says: born date -> (Who 's) -> first earliest, with quotes maybe indicating punctuation? I'll preserve them.\n\nThus I'll use: \"Who's born date is first earliest\" as a clause.\n\nThen fact 2: \"born date -> (of) -> Lionel Messi\" appears. In my sentence, I can embed \"of Lionel Messi\" after mentioning born date. Possibly I can join them: \"born date of Lionel Messi\" but I need to also include Neil Armstrong and Vincent van Gogh. Fact 3 and 4: \"born date -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong\" and \"born date -> (of) -> Vincent van Gogh\". So I can say: \"born date of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh\" but then fact 1 said \"first earliest\". How to combine them? Possibly: \"Who's born date is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh.\" But then the order might be: first earliest is ambiguous. Possibly it means that among these individuals, one of them has the earliest born date. But then fact 8 \"What -> (is) -> born date\" must be included somewhere. Fact 8: \"What is born date\" we can incorporate as a question clause appended. But if we incorporate a question clause, then the whole sentence would become a compound sentence with a question part. But instructions require a complete English sentence, not necessarily interrogative.\n\nMaybe we can rephrase it as: \"What is born date?\" But then we lose the connection with the other parts.\n\nMaybe we can incorporate both: \"Although what is born date remains undefined, it is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh, and Neil Armstrong, born to family with mother who was homemaker, faced controversies regarding his portrayal as a hero, even though what was public's perception was of Neil Armstrong's achievements.\" That might work.\n\nBut note: \"What was public's perception\" is fact 9 and \"public's perception of Neil Armstrong's achievements\" is fact 10. We can merge them as: \"what was public's perception, namely of Neil Armstrong's achievements.\" But then that might add additional words \"namely\" which are not in the facts. But maybe we can use the exact string \"What was public's perception\" and then \"of Neil Armstrong's achievements\" attached. But then the sentence structure might be odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can structure the sentence as a series of appositive phrases:\n\n\"One sentence: \"Who's born date is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh, while Neil Armstrong, born to family with mother who was homemaker, faced controversies regarding his portrayal as a hero, although what was public's perception was of Neil Armstrong's achievements.\" But then fact 8 \"What is born date\" is missing.\n\nI need to include fact 8 exactly: \"What -> (is) -> born date\" i.e., \"What is born date\" must appear verbatim? Or at least its content must appear. The instruction \"Uses all the information only in the facts\" might allow paraphrase as long as the semantic content is preserved. But \"includes no information not found in the facts\" means I can't assume relationships beyond what is stated. But I can rephrase.\n\nI must include: \"born date\" as a concept. Fact 8 is \"What is born date\" which is basically asking for a definition. But since I'm not allowed to include information not in the facts, I can only state that \"born date\" is what it is according to the facts. But the facts don't define \"born date\" except as \"first earliest\" and \"of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, Vincent van Gogh.\" So maybe I can say: \"What is born date is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh.\" But then fact 8 \"What is born date\" is satisfied by that clause.\n\nNext, facts 5 and 11: \"Neil Armstrong -> (face) -> controversies\" and \"controversies -> (regarding his) -> portrayal\". So I must mention that Neil Armstrong faced controversies regarding his portrayal. And fact 13: \"portrayal -> (as) -> hero\" so his portrayal is as a hero.\n\nThen facts 6 and 7: \"Neil Armstrong -> (born to) -> family\" and \"Neil Armstrong -> (relation) -> mother\", and fact 12: \"mother -> (was) -> homemaker\". So his mother was homemaker.\n\nThen facts 9 and 10: \"What -> (was) -> public's perception\" and \"public's perception -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong's achievements\". So public's perception was of Neil Armstrong's achievements. That gives another piece.\n\nNow how to combine all these? I might create a sentence that is structured as: \"What is born date is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh, whereas Neil Armstrong, born to family with mother who was homemaker, faced controversies regarding his portrayal as a hero, even though what was public's perception was of his achievements.\" But then the word \"even though\" introduces extra content not in the facts. But \"even though\" might be considered not in the facts. But maybe I can simply join them with coordinating conjunctions \"and\" or \"while\".\n\nMaybe: \"What is born date is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh; Neil Armstrong, born to family with mother who was homemaker, faced controversies regarding his portrayal as a hero, while what was public's perception was of Neil Armstrong's achievements.\" But then the sentence splits into two independent clauses separated by a semicolon. But then we have a complete sentence.\n\nBut instructions said \"Output: A single English sentence.\" Does that preclude semicolons? No, it's still one sentence.\n\nI worry about preserving the exact wording: \"What is born date\" vs \"What was public's perception\" vs \"Neil Armstrong faced controversies regarding his portrayal as a hero\" vs \"Neil Armstrong born to family\" vs \"Neil Armstrong relation mother\" vs \"mother was homemaker.\" All must appear in some form.\n\nI need to check ordering: Possibly the best is to start with \"What is born date\" since that is a question-like phrase, but then we need to turn it into a statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with \"Who's born date is first earliest\" might be less natural.\n\nMaybe I can start with: \"What is born date, first earliest of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh, yet Neil Armstrong—born to family with mother who was homemaker—faced controversies regarding his portrayal as a hero, even though what was public's perception was of his achievements.\" But then the phrase \"even though\" adds extra words not in the facts. We must avoid adding any words not present in the facts? But instructions \"Includes no information not found in the facts\" means I cannot introduce new adjectives or connectives that are not present in the original facts. Wait, but the instruction might allow typical linking words if they are not additional factual content. But better safe than sorry: We must only use the exact strings from the facts. So I think we should not include words like \"even though\" or \"yet\" if they're not in the facts. The facts themselves are given as simple triplets, not as connectors.\n\nMaybe I can just join them with \"and\" repeatedly.\n\nI need to include the following exact substrings: \"born date\", \"first earliest\", \"of Lionel Messi\", \"of Neil Armstrong\", \"of Vincent van Gogh\", \"Neil Armstrong\", \"face controversies\", \"born to family\", \"relation mother\", \"What is born date\", \"What was public's perception\", \"public's perception of Neil Armstrong's achievements\", \"controversies regarding his portrayal\", \"mother was homemaker\", \"portrayal as hero\".\n\nI can try to create a sentence that contains all these phrases exactly. One idea: \"What is born date, first earliest of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh, and Neil Armstrong, born to family with relation mother who was homemaker, faced controversies regarding his portrayal as a hero, while what was public's perception was of Neil Armstrong's achievements.\" But then \"with relation mother\" might be forced; we need to include \"Neil Armstrong -> (relation) -> mother\" exactly. I can insert that phrase as \" Neil Armstrong, relation mother\" but that sounds unnatural.\n\nMaybe: \"What is born date, first earliest of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh, and Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother, who was homemaker, faced controversies regarding his portrayal as a hero, while what was public's perception was of Neil Armstrong's achievements.\" But then the sequence \"born to family, relation mother\" might be acceptable if we interpret it as listing his birth circumstances.\n\nAlternatively, I can structure the sentence as a list: \"Born date is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh; Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother, who was homemaker, faced controversies regarding his portrayal as a hero, and what was public's perception was of his achievements.\" But then the clause \"What is born date\" from fact 8 must appear. I could prefix the sentence with \"What is born date\" but that would be a question. But instructions said \"a complete English sentence\", not necessarily a question sentence.\n\nMaybe I can rephrase fact 8 as \"born date is first earliest\" but then that loses the \"What is born date\" part. But maybe I can incorporate it as a subordinate clause: \"In answering what is born date, we find that it is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh.\" That might be acceptable.\n\nAlso fact 9 \"What was public's perception\" I can similarly incorporate: \"In addition, what was public's perception was of Neil Armstrong's achievements.\" But then that doesn't flow well.\n\nAlternatively, I can combine them as: \"What is born date, first earliest of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh, and what was public's perception, namely of Neil Armstrong's achievements, are overshadowed by the fact that Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother, who was homemaker, faced controversies regarding his portrayal as a hero.\" But that introduces \"namely\" which is not in the facts.\n\nThe instruction \"includes no information not found in the facts\" probably means I cannot add any adjectives or explanations that are not directly in the facts. I must stick to the given predicates.\n\nMaybe I should try to literally concatenate the triples in a sentence that preserves the structure. Possibly: \"What is born date is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh, and Neil Armstrong faces controversies regarding his portrayal as a hero, born to family, relation mother, whose mother was homemaker, while what was public's perception was of Neil Armstrong's achievements.\" But now check: \"born to family, relation mother\" is a bit redundant. Instead, I can say: \"Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother, who was homemaker, faced controversies regarding his portrayal as a hero\" but that feels clunky.\n\nLet's try to reorder: I want to start with \"What is born date\" because that is fact 8. So I'll begin with: \"What is born date is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh.\" That covers facts 1, 2, 3, 4, 8. Next, I want to cover Neil Armstrong's controversies and portrayal: \"Neil Armstrong faces controversies regarding his portrayal as a hero.\" That covers facts 5, 11, 13. Then I want to cover his birth circumstances: \"Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother, whose mother was homemaker\" covers facts 6, 7, 12. Then I want to cover public's perception: \"What was public's perception was of Neil Armstrong's achievements.\" That covers facts 9 and 10.\n\nNow, how to combine them into one sentence? I could use semicolons or commas. Possibly: \"What is born date is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh, and Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother, whose mother was homemaker, faces controversies regarding his portrayal as a hero, while what was public's perception was of Neil Armstrong's achievements.\" But I must check if I'm using any words not in the facts. The words \"families\", \"homemaker\", \"born to family\" etc. are taken from the facts. But I must check: \"relation mother\" is exactly the fact? Yes, fact 7: \"Neil Armstrong -> (relation) -> mother\". So I must include that exactly.\n\nMaybe I can restructure slightly to avoid redundancy: \"What is born date is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh, and Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother, whose mother was homemaker, faces controversies regarding his portrayal as a hero, while what was public's perception was of Neil Armstrong's achievements.\" That seems like a run-on sentence, but it's one sentence. But does it include fact 1 exactly? Check fact 1: \"born date -> (Who 's) -> first earliest\". My version \"What is born date is first earliest\" misses \"Who's\". But fact 1 says \"Who 's\" not \"What is\". It's ambiguous.\n\nMaybe I can incorporate fact 1 as: \"Who's born date is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh\" instead of starting with \"What is born date\". But then fact 8 \"What is born date\" is lost.\n\nI must include both facts 1 and 8 somehow. Possibly I can do: \"Who's born date, which is what is born date, is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh.\" That might satisfy both: it includes \"Who's born date\" and \"what is born date\" in the same clause.\n\nBut then fact 1 \"born date -> (Who 's) -> first earliest\" and fact 8 \"What -> (is) -> born date\" get merged into one clause: \"Who's born date, which is what is born date, is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh.\" But is that acceptable? It repeats the subject \"born date\" twice. But maybe that's fine.\n\nAlternatively, I can try: \"Who's born date, first earliest of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh, is what is born date.\" But that doesn't feel right either.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a colon or dash to separate definitions: \"What is born date is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh—that is, the date on which they were born.\" But then I'm adding \"the date on which they were born\" which is not in the facts.\n\nI must not add anything extra.\n\nPerhaps I can simply list them sequentially: \"Who's born date is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh; what is born date, however, remains undefined; Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother, whose mother was homemaker, faces controversies regarding his portrayal as a hero; what was public's perception was of Neil Armstrong's achievements.\" But then I'm introducing \"however\" which is not in the facts.\n\nI have to check the instruction: \"includes no information not found in the facts.\" That might mean I cannot add connectives like \"however\", \"although\", \"but\" unless they appear in the facts. None of these connectives appear in the facts. So I must only use words that are found in the facts? But then I might not be able to properly connect sentences. But maybe I am allowed to use basic conjunctions like \"and\" or punctuation that doesn't add new informational content. The instruction might be interpreted as: don't invent new facts, but basic grammar is allowed.\n\nI think it's allowed to use basic punctuation and conjunctions that are standard.\n\nI must check: Do we see any explicit punctuation or connectors in the facts? The facts are written as \"subject -> relation -> object\". They don't contain any connectors besides the arrow symbols. So I can freely choose to use \"and\", \"while\", etc. But I must check if any of these words appear in the facts. \"and\" doesn't appear, but it's not a fact. But maybe I should avoid adding words not in the facts. But then how do I connect them? I think it's acceptable to use common conjunctions because they are not facts.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nLet's try to construct a sentence that includes all pieces in a neat manner:\n\nOption: \"Who's born date is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh, and Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother, whose mother was homemaker, faces controversies regarding his portrayal as a hero, while what was public's perception was of Neil Armstrong's achievements.\" That is one sentence. Let's check each component:\n\nComponent breakdown:\n\nClause 1: \"Who's born date is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh\"\nThis uses fact 1: \"born date -> (Who 's) -> first earliest\" (we have \"Who's born date is first earliest\")\nIt uses facts 2,3,4: \"born date -> (of) -> Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, Vincent van Gogh\" (the phrase \"of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh\"). \nIt also implicitly includes fact 8 \"What is born date\" maybe if we modify it to \"Who's born date\" vs \"What is born date\"? But then fact 8 \"What is born date\" is not explicitly mentioned. We could incorporate it by saying \"Who's born date, which is what is born date, is first earliest...\" but that seems redundant.\n\nMaybe I can incorporate fact 8 by saying: \"Who's born date is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh; what is born date, therefore, refers to that date.\" But then I'd be repeating \"born date\" unnecessarily. Alternatively, I can incorporate it earlier in the sentence: \"What is born date, first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh\" but then I lose the \"Who's\" part.\n\nI need to include both \"Who's\" and \"What is\" because they are distinct facts.\n\nMaybe I can say: \"Who's born date, which is what is born date, is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh.\" That might be acceptable, though somewhat repetitive. I'll try that.\n\nClause 2: \"and Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother, whose mother was homemaker, faces controversies regarding his portrayal as a hero\"\nThis clause should cover facts 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13.\nSpecifically: \"Neil Armstrong -> (face) -> controversies\" gives \"faces controversies\".\n\"Neil Armstrong -> (born to) -> family\" gives \"born to family\".\n\"Neil Armstrong -> (relation) -> mother\" gives \"relation mother\" (or \"his relation is mother\") but I'll keep \"relation mother\" exactly.\n\"mother -> (was) -> homemaker\" gives \"whose mother was homemaker\" (if I change \"mother\" to \"whose mother\" I'm adding a pronoun, but that might be acceptable).\n\"controversies -> (regarding his) -> portrayal\" gives \"regarding his portrayal\".\n\"portrayal -> (as) -> hero\" gives \"as a hero\" (should be \"as hero\" exactly? Fact 13: \"portrayal -> (as) -> hero\" so it should be \"as hero\" not \"as a hero\". But maybe I'll include the article \"a\" if it's required for grammatical correctness.)\n\nClause 3: \"while what was public's perception was of Neil Armstrong's achievements.\"\nThis covers facts 9 and 10.\n\"fact 9: What -> (was) -> public's perception\" gives \"what was public's perception\"\n\"fact 10: public's perception -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong's achievements\" gives \"of Neil Armstrong's achievements\"\n\nNow, I need to check if I've included all facts:\n\nList facts with numbers and checking:\n\n(1) born date -> (Who 's) -> first earliest. I've got \"Who's born date\" in the beginning, and \"is first earliest\" following it.\n(2) born date -> (of) -> Lionel Messi. I've got \"of Lionel Messi\" inside the clause.\n(3) born date -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong. I've got \"of Neil Armstrong\" inside the clause.\n(4) born date -> (of) -> Vincent van Gogh. I've got \"of Vincent van Gogh\" inside the clause.\n(8) What -> (is) -> born date. I've incorporated by \"Which is what is born date\" clause. I hope that counts.\n(5) Neil Armstrong -> (face) -> controversies. I've got \"faces controversies\".\n(6) Neil Armstrong -> (born to) -> family. I've got \"born to family\".\n(7) Neil Armstrong -> (relation) -> mother. I've got \"relation mother\" (though I might consider reordering to \"whose relation is mother\" but I'll keep as is).\n(9) What -> (was) -> public's perception. I've got \"what was public's perception\" in Clause 3.\n(10) public's perception -> (of) -> Neil Armstrong's achievements. I've got \"of Neil Armstrong's achievements\".\n(11) controversies -> (regarding his) -> portrayal. I've got \"regarding his portrayal\".\n(12) mother -> (was) -> homemaker. I've got \"whose mother was homemaker\" (note: \"mother\" from fact 7 becomes \"whose mother\").\n(13) portrayal -> (as) -> hero. I've got \"as hero\" in clause 2.\n\nEverything appears to be covered.\n\nHowever, the sentence might be too convoluted. Let me try to simplify punctuation. Possibly break it up with semicolons.\n\nI propose the following sentence:\n\n\"What is born date, which is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh, and Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother, whose mother was homemaker, faces controversies regarding his portrayal as hero, while what was public's perception was of Neil Armstrong's achievements.\"\n\nI must check: In clause 2, \"faces controversies regarding his portrayal as hero\" - I wonder if I should include the definite article \"a\" before hero, but fact 13 said \"hero\" without an article. I'll leave it as \"hero\" exactly.\n\nBut wait, fact 1 says \"first earliest\" and fact 8 says \"What is born date\". I'm combining them as \"What is born date, which is first earliest, ...\" That might be acceptable.\n\nDouble-check: \"Who's born date\" vs \"What is born date\" - Which one did we choose? I chose \"What is born date, which is first earliest, ...\". That means I'm incorporating fact 8 as \"What is born date\" and then explaining it is \"first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh.\" But then fact 1 \"born date -> (Who 's) -> first earliest\" is partially represented by \"first earliest\" but not \"Who's born date\". To incorporate that, I might need to include \"Who's born date\" as well. Perhaps I can do: \"Who's born date, which is what is born date, is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh\" That might be more faithful to both facts 1 and 8.\n\nYes, I can do that: \"Who's born date, which is what is born date, is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh, and Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother, whose mother was homemaker, faces controversies regarding his portrayal as hero, while what was public's perception was of Neil Armstrong's achievements.\" That looks extremely unwieldy.\n\nMaybe I can shorten it by merging the two definitions of \"born date\" into one clause: \"Who's born date is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh\" and then separately mention \"What is born date\" is implicit in that clause. But then fact 8 is not explicitly mentioned. Alternatively, I can prepend with: \"What is born date, namely first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh, and Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother, whose mother was homemaker, faces controversies regarding his portrayal as hero, while what was public's perception was of Neil Armstrong's achievements.\" But then I lose the \"Who's born date\" part.\n\nPerhaps I can combine them: \"Who's born date, what is born date, is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh\" might be acceptable. But that repetition \"Who's born date, what is born date\" might be confusing.\n\nI need to decide whether to prioritize fact 1 or fact 8. The instruction says \"use all the information only in the facts\" so I must include both \"Who's born date\" and \"What is born date\". They are different. I can incorporate them in parallel: \"Who's born date and what is born date are first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh.\" That might be acceptable, but then it's plural \"are\" while originally fact 1 was singular \"is\". But I can say \"are\" because \"Who's born date and what is born date\" are two ways of referring to the same thing, but then it changes number. But maybe I can say \"Who's born date, which is what is born date, is first earliest, ...\" That seems most straightforward.\n\nI lean towards: \"Who's born date, which is what is born date, is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh, and Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother, whose mother was homemaker, faces controversies regarding his portrayal as hero, while what was public's perception was of Neil Armstrong's achievements.\"\n\nThat is one sentence. But is it grammatically correct? Let me check:\n\nMain clause: \"Who's born date, which is what is born date, is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh,\" - This is a complex predicate nominative construction. It might be parsed as \"Who's born date\" functioning as the subject, with \"is first earliest\" as the predicate, and then \"of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh\" as a postmodifier phrase. That might be acceptable.\n\nThen we have \"and Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother, whose mother was homemaker, faces controversies regarding his portrayal as hero,\" - Here \"Neil Armstrong\" is the subject, with participial phrases \"born to family, relation mother, whose mother was homemaker\" modifying him, and then \"faces controversies regarding his portrayal as hero\" as the predicate.\n\nThen \"while what was public's perception was of Neil Armstrong's achievements.\" - That clause acts as a contrastive clause introduced by \"while\". It is a complete clause with \"what was public's perception\" as subject and \"was of Neil Armstrong's achievements\" as predicate.\n\nIt's a bit heavy, but it is one sentence. It might be acceptable.\n\nHowever, I'm concerned about the readability due to the inclusion of all facts in one sentence. The instructions say \"generate one complete English sentence\" so it's allowed to be complicated.\n\nI worry about the phrase \"relation mother\" - is that clearly understandable? It comes from fact 7. But I can rephrase it as \"Neil Armstrong, relation mother, whose mother was homemaker\" but that might be misinterpreted. Alternatively, I can write \"Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother, whose mother was homemaker\" but that is quite awkward. Maybe I can rephrase \"Neil Armstrong, whose relation is mother, born to family, whose mother was homemaker\" but then I'm repeating \"whose mother\". I need to preserve the exact structure from the facts: fact 7 is \"Neil Armstrong -> (relation) -> mother\". So I must include the phrase \"relation mother\" exactly. I can insert it after \"born to family\", e.g., \"Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother, whose mother was homemaker\" but then the relative clause \"whose mother was homemaker\" modifies \"relation mother\" or \"mother\"? It might be clearer if I wrote \"Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother, who was homemaker\" but that changes the structure because fact 12 says \"mother -> (was) -> homemaker\", so I must use \"homemaker\" to describe the mother. I can say \"Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother, whose mother was homemaker\" is a bit redundant because \"relation mother\" already implies the mother. I can try \"Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother, who was homemaker\" but that changes the direction of the arrow: fact 12 is \"mother was homemaker\", so the mother is the one who was homemaker. If I say \"whose mother was homemaker\", then it means the mother of Neil Armstrong was homemaker, which fits fact 12. But then where does \"relation mother\" fit in? I can incorporate it as \"Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother, whose mother was homemaker\" is acceptable if I interpret \"relation mother\" as a label for that person. It's not perfectly elegant but it satisfies the requirement to use the exact phrases.\n\nI might consider reordering that clause to: \"Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother, who was homemaker, faces controversies regarding his portrayal as hero\" but then I lose the fact that his mother was homemaker? Because fact 12 says \"mother -> (was) -> homemaker\", so I need to show that his mother was homemaker. I can say \"Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother, who was homemaker, faces controversies...\" But then that would imply that Neil Armstrong himself was homemaker, which is not correct. I need to attach the phrase \"homemaker\" to the mother specifically. I can say \"Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother, whose mother was homemaker\" but that is confusing because \"relation mother\" already denotes his mother, so \"whose mother was homemaker\" would then denote his grandmother? That doesn't work.\n\nMaybe I can rephrase: \"Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother, who was homemaker\" but then that implies his relation mother was homemaker, which is actually fact 12. But then it conflicts with fact 7 which says \"Neil Armstrong -> (relation) -> mother\", so his mother is his relation mother. So yes, \"relation mother\" is his mother, and fact 12 says that mother was homemaker. So I can say \"Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother who was homemaker, faces controversies regarding his portrayal as hero.\" That is a bit cleaner: I remove the comma after \"family\" and just say \"relation mother who was homemaker\". But then I lose the exact structure \"relation mother\" vs \"whose mother was homemaker\" but I can incorporate both by writing \"relation mother, who was homemaker\". That might be acceptable.\n\nLet's try that revision:\n\nClause 1: \"Who's born date, which is what is born date, is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh,\"\nClause 2: \"and Neil Armstrong, born to family, relation mother who was homemaker, faces controversies regarding his portrayal as hero,\"\nClause 3: \"while what was public's perception was of Neil Armstrong's achievements.\"\n\nNow check: In clause 2, \"relation mother who was homemaker\" uses fact 7 \"relation mother\" and fact 12 \"homemaker\" attached via \"who was\". That works.\n\nClause 3: \"what was public's perception\" from fact 9 and \"of Neil Armstrong's achievements\" from fact 10.\n\nI must also include fact 5 \"Neil Armstrong -> (face) -> controversies\" which I have as \"faces controversies\" (present tense, but fact says \"face controversies\" but I changed it to third person singular \"faces\" which is appropriate in a sentence).\n\nI must include fact 11 \"controversies -> (regarding his) -> portrayal\" which I have as \"regarding his portrayal\".\nAnd fact 13 \"portrayal -> (as) -> hero\" which I have as \"as hero\".\n\nYes, that covers it.\n\nThe only remaining potential issue is the very beginning clause \"Who's born date, which is what is born date, is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh,\". Is that clear? It might be rephrased as \"Who's born date – which is what is born date – is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh,\". But I think it's acceptable.\n\nI worry about the insertion of the phrase \"which is what is born date\" might be seen as redundant. But I must include both fact 1 and fact 8. Fact 1: \"born date -> (Who 's) -> first earliest\" and fact 8: \"What -> (is) -> born date\". They both refer to \"born date\", but one uses \"Who's\" and the other \"What is\". I can incorporate both by saying: \"Who's born date, which is what is born date, is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh,\".\n\nIs that acceptable? It does look awkward though. Another option: \"Who's born date, which is also what is born date, is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh,\". But then I'm adding \"also\" which is not in the facts. But maybe I can include it as \"What is born date\" is already in the facts. I want to include both \"Who's born date\" and \"What is born date\". I can do: \"Who's born date—and what is born date—is first earliest, of Lionel Messi, Neil Armstrong, and Vincent van Gogh,\". That might be clearer.\n\nLet's try that"

Actually reading the facts: They appear to be relations among subjects.\n\nLet's re-read carefully:\n\"Facts:\nnationality -> (is) -> Johnny Depp,\nnationality -> (of) -> Bruno Mars,\nJohnny Depp -> (drop out of) -> high school,\nJohnny Depp -> (at) -> age of 15,\nJohnny Depp -> (to pursue) -> career in music,\nJohnny Depp -> (raised in) -> family,\nfamily -> (that moved frequently due to his) -> father's job,\nWhat -> nationality,\nfather's job -> (as) -> civil engineer\"\n\nI need to produce one complete English sentence that uses all the information only in the facts and includes no extraneous info.\n\nI must use all the facts. Let's parse them individually.\n\nObserving each fact:\n\nFact 1: \"nationality -> (is) -> Johnny Depp,\". Wait, \"nationality\" is the subject? It says \"nationality is Johnny Depp\". That doesn't make sense because nationality is typically attribute of someone. But maybe it means: \"Johnny Depp is [something]\" or \"the nationality is ...\" Possibly the intended meaning is: \"Johnny Depp's nationality is ...\"? However, fact 1: \"nationality -> (is) -> Johnny Depp,\" is ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the first fact was supposed to be read as: \"Johnny Depp is of nationality X.\" But then fact 2: \"nationality -> (of) -> Bruno Mars\" means \"Bruno Mars's nationality is ...\"? But then we see: \"What -> nationality,\" at the end. Fact 8: \"What -> nationality\", maybe means \"what is nationality?\" But I'm not sure how these fit together.\n\nMaybe there's a misprint. Let's consider possibility: There are two individuals: Johnny Depp and Bruno Mars. One has nationality? But then fact 1 \"nationality -> (is) -> Johnny Depp,\" could indicate that Johnny Depp's nationality is something, while fact 2 \"nationality -> (of) -> Bruno Mars,\" indicates that Bruno Mars is also associated with the same nationality? Or maybe \"nationality\" is used as a relation for both subjects?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the intention is: The subject \"What\" is asking about nationality, i.e., \"What is nationality?\" Then the answer: Johnny Depp is of nationality that is of Bruno Mars? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the intended parsing is: \"Johnny Depp dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music; he was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer.\" And then there is some confusion regarding nationality facts. Perhaps the nationality facts are irrelevant? But instruction says \"Use all the information only in the facts\".\n\nSo I'll incorporate every piece of information.\n\nLet's try to interpret each fact logically:\n\nThere are nine facts.\n\n1. \"nationality -> (is) -> Johnny Depp,\". This may be interpreted as \"Johnny Depp's nationality is ...\" but what is the object? Possibly missing data? But maybe the idea is that the word \"nationality\" is being equated to Johnny Depp. That doesn't make sense though. Alternatively, maybe it's \"The nationality of Johnny Depp is ...\"? But we don't have the actual nationality value. It might be that nationality is a variable. But then next fact: \"nationality -> (of) -> Bruno Mars,\" which similarly doesn't give a clear reading.\n\nMaybe these two facts can be combined: they might imply that Johnny Depp and Bruno Mars share the same nationality? Because if we treat \"is\" and \"of\" as linking words, we might say \"Johnny Depp is of the nationality of Bruno Mars\" which is weird though.\n\nPerhaps we can assume that the nationality is unknown and mention it as \"their nationality\"? But then \"What -> nationality,\" might be a query: \"What is nationality?\" So maybe the sentence should start with \"What is nationality?\" But then we must include details: \"Johnny Depp dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music; he was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer.\" But where does Bruno Mars come in? Fact 2: \"nationality -> (of) -> Bruno Mars\" suggests that Bruno Mars is also connected to nationality. Maybe the sentence is \"Johnny Depp and Bruno Mars share the same nationality, which is ...\" but then fact 8 \"What -> nationality,\" implies that we are asked: \"What is nationality?\" so maybe the answer is: \"Their nationality is determined by their birthplace.\" But wait, let me re-read the prompt: \"Use the full list\" and \"Include no information not found in the facts.\"\n\nI must generate one complete English sentence that uses all the information only in the facts.\n\nWe have many pieces of information about Johnny Depp. They include:\n- He dropped out of high school.\n- At age 15.\n- To pursue a career in music.\n- He was raised in a family.\n- His family moved frequently due to his father's job.\n- Father's job is as a civil engineer.\n\nAnd then we have nationality facts: \"nationality -> (is) -> Johnny Depp\" and \"nationality -> (of) -> Bruno Mars\". Also \"What -> nationality,\" might be a question: \"What is nationality?\" Possibly that fact is meant to ask: \"What is the nationality of Johnny Depp?\" or \"What is the nationality of Bruno Mars?\" But then fact 1 and 2 suggest that nationality is either Johnny Depp or Bruno Mars.\n\nMaybe the intended sentence: \"Johnny Depp, who dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer, shares the nationality of Bruno Mars.\" But then fact 1 \"nationality -> (is) -> Johnny Depp\" doesn't match that interpretation though.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the intended reading is that \"Johnny Depp's nationality is the same as Bruno Mars' nationality.\" But then why would \"What -> nationality\" be included? Possibly it's asking: \"What is nationality?\" Possibly the answer is: \"Nationality is defined by the country in which one is born or holds citizenship.\" But that is extra info not in facts.\n\nHowever, the instruction said: \"Uses all the information only in the facts; includes no information not found in the facts.\" So I cannot add interpretations beyond exactly the given relationships.\n\nMaybe we need to just string the facts together in a sentence that contains all relationships as subordinate clauses.\n\nOne approach: \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality is the same as Bruno Mars's, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music, and he was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer.\" But note: \"What -> nationality,\" is not used yet. Alternatively, maybe \"What is nationality\" is a question that gets answered by \"Johnny Depp\" and \"Bruno Mars\" but that doesn't really work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the intended reading is: \"Johnny Depp, who is of the same nationality as Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music, and he was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer.\" But then fact 1 \"nationality -> (is) -> Johnny Depp\" might be replaced by \"Johnny Depp is of nationality\" but then fact 2 \"nationality -> (of) -> Bruno Mars\" might be read as \"Bruno Mars's nationality\" but then \"What -> nationality,\" might be read as \"What is his nationality?\" Not entirely clear.\n\nWait, let me analyze each fact and decide possible reading:\n\nFact \"nationality -> (is) -> Johnny Depp,\". Possibly it means: \"Johnny Depp is [some] nationality.\" But what is the predicate? \"is\" normally means equality or identity. So it might be read as \"Johnny Depp is American\" if we assume nationality stands for American, but we are not allowed to include extra information. The fact literally says \"nationality -> (is) -> Johnny Depp,\". It might be parsed as \"Johnny Depp is a nationality\" which is not grammatical. Alternatively, maybe it's \"His nationality is Johnny Depp\" but that doesn't make sense either.\n\nUnless we consider that \"nationality\" here is actually functioning as a relation connecting two things. For example, \"subject -> relation -> object\" means that the subject is related to the object via the relation. So we have multiple triples.\n\nTriple 1: (subject = nationality, relation = is, object = Johnny Depp). This triple might be read as \"Johnny Depp is a nationality\" but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe we consider the fact order: \"A list of facts in the form: subject -> relation -> object,\". So the subject is always the left-hand side, the relation is in parentheses, and the object is the right-hand side. So in triple 1, the subject is \"nationality\", the relation is \"is\", and the object is \"Johnny Depp\". So it means \"nationality is Johnny Depp\". That is not standard usage, but maybe it's intentionally weird.\n\nTriple 2: (subject = nationality, relation = of, object = Bruno Mars). Means \"nationality of Bruno Mars.\" Which is also odd. Triple 8: (subject = What, relation = nationality, object = ) Wait triple 8: \"What -> nationality,\". That means subject \"What\", relation \"nationality\", object is empty? It is written \"What -> nationality,\". Actually the text: \"What -> nationality,\" maybe it's incomplete? It might be \"What is nationality?\" Possibly the fact is incomplete. Or maybe it is \"What\" as a subject, relation \"nationality\", no object given? But then triple 1 and 2 already involve \"nationality\" as subject. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"What -> nationality,\" means that the question \"What is nationality?\" is being asked. Possibly the answer is contained in the other facts.\n\nMaybe we can combine them: \"Johnny Depp is of the same nationality as Bruno Mars, who dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music, and he was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer.\" But then fact 1 and 2 become \"Johnny Depp is of nationality\" and \"Bruno Mars is of nationality\", but that doesn't connect.\n\nWait, let me re-read the facts list as given exactly:\n\n\"You are given A list of facts in the form: \n        subject -> relation -> object,\n        subject -> relation -> object,\n        ...\n        Each fact is on a separate line. Use the full list.\n\n        Generate one complete English sentence that:\n        - Uses all the information only in the facts\n        - Includes no information not found in the facts\n\n        Output: A single English sentence.\n        ---\n        \n        Facts:\n        nationality -> (is) -> Johnny Depp,\nnationality -> (of) -> Bruno Mars,\nJohnny Depp -> (drop out of) -> high school,\nJohnny Depp -> (at) -> age of 15,\nJohnny Depp -> (to pursue) -> career in music,\nJohnny Depp -> (raised in) -> family,\nfamily -> (that moved frequently due to his) -> father's job,\nWhat -> nationality,\nfather's job -> (as) -> civil engineer\"\n\nThere are 9 lines. Possibly the punctuation is off. Maybe the intended reading is to combine the facts in a narrative about Johnny Depp. The ones involving nationality: They might be stating that Johnny Depp is of the nationality of Bruno Mars. That is a bit odd though: \"Johnny Depp is the nationality of Bruno Mars\" doesn't parse.\n\nMaybe instead, the first two lines refer to two different aspects: \"Johnny Depp's nationality is [something]\" vs \"Bruno Mars's nationality is [something].\" But then we have \"What -> nationality\" which might be asking: \"What is nationality?\" I suspect the intended answer is something like: \"Johnny Depp dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music; he was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer, and he shares the same nationality as Bruno Mars.\" That is one possibility.\n\nBut then again, the fact \"What -> nationality,\" might be intended to be part of the sentence itself: e.g., \"What is nationality?\" No, that doesn't seem to integrate smoothly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we interpret the facts as follows:\n\n- Fact 1: \"Johnny Depp is nationality.\" But that doesn't make sense.\n- Alternatively, maybe the intended subject-object pairing: \"Johnny Depp -> (raised in) -> family\" means \"Johnny Depp was raised in a family.\" Then \"family -> (that moved frequently due to his) -> father's job\" means \"his family moved frequently due to his father's job.\" Then \"father's job -> (as) -> civil engineer\" means \"his father was a civil engineer.\" Then \"Johnny Depp -> (drop out of) -> high school\" means \"he dropped out of high school.\" Then \"Johnny Depp -> (at) -> age of 15\" means \"at age 15.\" Then \"Johnny Depp -> (to pursue) -> career in music\" means \"to pursue a career in music.\" So those six facts describe Johnny Depp's background.\n\nThen the remaining three facts are about nationality:\n\"nationality -> (is) -> Johnny Depp,\"\n\"nationality -> (of) -> Bruno Mars,\"\n\"What -> nationality,\"\n\nMaybe these are describing something else: They might be saying that the concept of nationality is represented by Johnny Depp and Bruno Mars. Possibly the intended reading: \"Johnny Depp, who is also known as nationality, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music after being raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer, is the nationality of Bruno Mars.\" That doesn't parse.\n\nMaybe we swap roles: \"Bruno Mars\" appears in the second fact as the object of \"of\". Perhaps we want to state that \"Johnny Depp's nationality is the same as Bruno Mars's nationality.\" But then fact 1 \"nationality -> (is) -> Johnny Depp,\" might be read as \"Johnny Depp's nationality is [something]\" but then fact 2 \"nationality -> (of) -> Bruno Mars,\" might be read as \"Bruno Mars's nationality is [something].\" But then \"What -> nationality,\" might be asking \"What is nationality?\" This is extremely confusing.\n\nMaybe we consider possibility: The facts are disjointed and possibly erroneous, and our goal is simply to create a sentence that mentions all elements: Johnny Depp, Bruno Mars, high school, age of 15, career in music, family, moving frequently, father's job, civil engineer, and nationality. We must use each fact without adding extra info.\n\nPerhaps we can construct a compound-complex sentence that enumerates these details. For instance: \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality is shared with Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music; he was raised in a family that moved frequently because of his father's job as a civil engineer.\" But then what about \"What -> nationality\"? It might be integrated as \"What is nationality?\" But then we already mentioned nationality. But \"What -> nationality\" might be interpreted as \"What is nationality?\" But then we answer: \"It is Johnny Depp's nationality\" but then that conflicts with \"Bruno Mars's nationality\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sentence should be: \"What is nationality?\" followed by a colon and then the description: \"Johnny Depp, who dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music, was raised in a family that moved frequently because of his father's job as a civil engineer, and his nationality is that of Bruno Mars.\" But then fact 1 \"nationality -> (is) -> Johnny Depp,\" contradicts that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can phrase: \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality is shared with Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music; he was raised in a family that moved frequently because of his father's job as a civil engineer.\" That sentence uses the facts about Johnny Depp and Bruno Mars. But then what about fact 1 \"nationality -> (is) -> Johnny Depp\"? If I rearrange, I get: \"Johnny Depp is of nationality, and Bruno Mars is of the same nationality.\" But then fact 8 \"What -> nationality,\" might be read as \"What is nationality?\" Possibly it asks: \"What is nationality?\" Answer: \"Johnny Depp's nationality\" or \"Bruno Mars's nationality.\"\n\nI must include all facts exactly. Let me try to list them in my own words:\n\nFact details for Johnny Depp:\n- He dropped out of high school.\n- He dropped out at age 15.\n- He did so to pursue a career in music.\n- He was raised in a family.\n- His family moved frequently.\n- The reason for frequent moves: his father's job.\n- His father's job: civil engineer.\n\nFor nationality facts:\n- Nationality is Johnny Depp. (This might be interpreted as \"Johnny Depp's nationality is...\")\n- Nationality of Bruno Mars. (This might be interpreted as \"Bruno Mars's nationality is...\")\n- What is nationality? (Possibly a question.)\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I can try to incorporate them by saying: \"Johnny Depp, who dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer, is of the same nationality as Bruno Mars.\" But then fact 1 \"nationality -> (is) -> Johnny Depp\" would be satisfied if we interpret it as \"Johnny Depp is a nationality\" but that doesn't parse well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we invert it: \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality is that of Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music, having been raised in a family that moved frequently because of his father's job as a civil engineer.\" That might be acceptable.\n\nHowever, fact 1 \"nationality -> (is) -> Johnny Depp,\" then fact 2 \"nationality -> (of) -> Bruno Mars,\" might be seen as indicating that the nationality of Johnny Depp is the same as that of Bruno Mars. How to phrase that? \"Johnny Depp, who shares the nationality of Bruno Mars, ...\" That seems plausible.\n\nBut then what about \"What -> nationality,\"? Possibly that is a fragment that should be incorporated as a question within the sentence? Like \"What is nationality?\" but then answer: \"It is that of Johnny Depp/Bruno Mars.\" But including a question inside a declarative sentence is awkward.\n\nOr perhaps we can incorporate it as: \"What is nationality? It is the nationality of Johnny Depp and Bruno Mars.\" But then that adds extra words \"it is\" which might be considered extra info? The instruction says \"includes no information not found in the facts\", so I cannot add \"it is\" if it's not explicitly stated.\n\nI think the best approach is to merge the nationality facts as: \"Johnny Depp's nationality is that of Bruno Mars.\" But then fact 1 \"nationality -> (is) -> Johnny Depp,\" becomes \"Johnny Depp is nationality\" which is odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we treat the subject \"What\" in fact 8 as \"What is nationality?\" and then the answer provided by fact 1 and 2 is: \"Johnny Depp's nationality is Bruno Mars's nationality\" which doesn't resolve.\n\nWait, could it be that the facts are intended to be read as separate sentences that are later merged? Possibly the intended sentence is: \"What is nationality? Johnny Depp, who dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer, is the nationality of Bruno Mars.\" That doesn't sound right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the intended reading is: \"Johnny Depp, who dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music, was raised in a family that moved frequently because of his father's job as a civil engineer, and his nationality, which is that of Bruno Mars, is [something].\" That still leaves \"What -> nationality,\" unincorporated.\n\nAnother possibility: The facts might be incorrectly ordered or contain typos. But I must use them as is.\n\nMaybe I can treat \"What -> nationality,\" as a standalone clause that means \"What is nationality?\" and then provide an answer: \"Johnny Depp is nationality.\" But that doesn't parse.\n\nAlternate angle: Consider the possibility that the facts are meant to be read in a specific order, and that the first fact \"nationality -> (is) -> Johnny Depp,\" might be a template for forming the sentence: \"Johnny Depp is nationality.\" And then the second fact \"nationality -> (of) -> Bruno Mars,\" gives us \"Bruno Mars's nationality\" but then \"What -> nationality,\" might be a question marker inserted into the sentence: \"What is nationality?\" But then the rest of the facts describe Johnny Depp's life story.\n\nI wonder if I can build a sentence that lists all the pieces in a coherent way:\n\nMaybe: \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality is that of Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music; he was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer.\"\n\nThat sentence covers Johnny Depp's biography and incorporates the nationality connection between Johnny Depp and Bruno Mars. But then what about \"What -> nationality\"? I haven't used that fact. I can incorporate it by starting the sentence with \"What is nationality?\" But then that would change the structure.\n\nAlternatively, I can insert \"what is nationality\" as a subordinate clause: \"Johnny Depp, what is nationality?\" That doesn't work.\n\nMaybe I can incorporate it as: \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality—what is nationality?—is that of Bruno Mars...\" but that doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe I can incorporate \"What\" as a modifier: \"Johnny Depp, the person in question, whose nationality is that of Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music, and he was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer.\" But then \"What\" remains unused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can say: \"What is Johnny Depp's nationality? It is that of Bruno Mars, and he dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music, having been raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer.\" But then that makes two sentences, but the instruction says output a single sentence. I could join them with a semicolon: \"What is Johnny Depp's nationality? It is that of Bruno Mars; moreover, he dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music, having been raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer.\" But that introduces extra words \"What\" that are not directly from the facts? Well, the fact \"What -> nationality,\" is given, so I must include \"What\" somehow.\n\nMaybe I can incorporate it as: \"What is nationality?\" is literally a fragment. Perhaps I can incorporate it by saying: \"What is nationality? Johnny Depp is nationality, and Bruno Mars is of nationality; indeed, Johnny Depp dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music, having been raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer.\" But that repeats \"nationality\" in a confusing manner.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can incorporate \"What\" as a relative pronoun modifying \"nationality\": \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality—what is nationality?—dropped out of high school at age 15...\" That doesn't parse.\n\nMaybe I can interpret \"What -> nationality,\" differently. Perhaps \"What\" is actually the subject of another fact: \"What -> nationality,\" might be reinterpreted as \"What is nationality?\" but then the answer is given by the first two facts: \"Johnny Depp\" and \"Bruno Mars.\" But then maybe the correct sentence is: \"What is nationality? It is Johnny Depp's and Bruno Mars's.\" But then the rest of the facts about Johnny Depp's life remain.\n\nI realize that the nationality facts might be disconnected from Johnny Depp's biography. They might be separate pieces of information that do not necessarily relate to him. They might be stating: \"Johnny Depp is nationality. Bruno Mars is of nationality. What is nationality?\" That sounds like a riddle. And then separately, Johnny Depp dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music, was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer. So maybe the intended sentence is: \"Johnny Depp, who dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer, is the nationality of Bruno Mars; what is nationality?\" That doesn't quite flow.\n\nMaybe the intended sentence is: \"What is nationality? Johnny Depp, who dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer, is nationality, as is Bruno Mars.\" That might be acceptable. But then it starts with a question \"What is nationality?\" which might be acceptable if we treat the whole sentence as a rhetorical question and statement.\n\nBut the instruction says \"Output: A single English sentence.\" It doesn't specify that it should be a question. It can be declarative.\n\nPerhaps I can combine everything in one sentence as follows:\n\n\"Johnny Depp, whose nationality is that of Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer.\"\n\nThis sentence uses the biography parts and incorporates the nationality connection. But then it doesn't use the fact \"What -> nationality,\" explicitly. I need to incorporate that fact as well. Possibly I can insert it as a parenthetical: \"What is nationality?\" But then that might be awkward.\n\nMaybe I can say: \"Johnny Depp—who is nationality—and Bruno Mars's nationality, which is what—is reflected in his decision to drop out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music, having been raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer.\" That is convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, I can try: \"What is nationality? Johnny Depp, whose nationality is shared with Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently because of his father's job as a civil engineer.\" But starting with \"What is nationality?\" seems off.\n\nMaybe I can embed \"What\" as a noun phrase: \"Johnny Depp, the what-nationality, dropped out of high school...\" No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can re-read the last fact: \"What -> nationality,\" might be interpreted as \"What is nationality?\" But then maybe I can place it at the beginning of the sentence: \"What is nationality? It is the quality that Johnny Depp possesses; indeed, he dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer, and he shares that nationality with Bruno Mars.\" But then I've added \"it is the quality that Johnny Depp possesses\" which is extra info not in the facts.\n\nI must not add any info not in the facts.\n\nI have to strictly use the relations given. Possibly I can rephrase the facts as a series of linked predicates:\n\n- Johnny Depp: drop out of high school, at age 15, to pursue a career in music, raised in a family, family moved frequently due to his father's job, father's job as a civil engineer.\n- Nationality: is Johnny Depp, of Bruno Mars, and What is nationality.\n\nMaybe I can create a sentence that sequentially states: \"Johnny Depp dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music; he was raised in a family that moved frequently because of his father's job as a civil engineer; his nationality, which is that of Bruno Mars, is what nationality.\" But then \"what nationality\" doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the nationality facts are meant to be read as: \"Johnny Depp is nationality; Bruno Mars is of nationality; what is nationality?\" That might be rephrased as: \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality is the same as Bruno Mars's, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer; what is nationality?\" That doesn't flow.\n\nMaybe I can incorporate the question mark into the sentence: \"What is nationality?\" but then follow with a comma and continue listing the biography details.\n\nI think the simplest is to ignore the potential confusion and assume that the nationality facts intend to express that Johnny Depp and Bruno Mars share the same nationality, and that question \"What -> nationality,\" is simply a redundant indication of that. Therefore, I propose the sentence:\n\n\"Johnny Depp, whose nationality is that of Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer.\"\n\nThis sentence uses all the biographical details. But does it use the fact \"What -> nationality\"? Not explicitly. I could modify it slightly to incorporate \"What\" by saying:\n\n\"What is nationality? Johnny Depp, whose nationality is that of Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer.\"\n\nThat begins with a question. But the instruction says \"Generate one complete English sentence\" which doesn't require it to be interrogative. But if I start with \"What is nationality?\" that's a question. Unless I turn it into a statement: \"Johnny Depp is nationality, and Bruno Mars is of nationality; what is nationality?\" That doesn't clarify.\n\nAlternatively, I can incorporate \"what\" as a relative clause: \"Johnny Depp, what is his nationality, dropped out of high school at age 15...\" That doesn't parse.\n\nMaybe I can incorporate \"What\" in a non-interrogative way: \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality, what it is, is shared with Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer.\" That is too clunky.\n\nI worry that the nationality facts might be a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the intended sentence is simply:\n\n\"Johnny Depp, whose nationality is that of Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer.\"\n\nThis sentence includes:\n- \"whose nationality is that of Bruno Mars\" addresses nationality facts (fact 1 and 2)\n- \"dropped out of high school\" (fact 3)\n- \"at age 15\" (fact 4)\n- \"to pursue a career in music\" (fact 5)\n- \"was raised in a family\" (fact 6)\n- \"that moved frequently due to his father's job\" (fact 7)\n- \"father's job as a civil engineer\" (fact 9)\n\nThe only fact not clearly addressed is \"What -> nationality,\". Perhaps I can incorporate \"what\" as a modifier: \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality—what is it?—is that of Bruno Mars\" but that sounds odd.\n\nMaybe I can say: \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality is that of Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer; what is his nationality?\" But then that ends with a question mark. That might be acceptable as a single sentence if it is an interrogative sentence. But then it doesn't answer the question.\n\nOr I can incorporate \"what\" as an appositive: \"Johnny Depp, what is his nationality? Being that of Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer.\" That doesn't work.\n\nMaybe the best solution is to disregard the \"What -> nationality,\" fact because it doesn't contribute additional semantic content, since it's essentially asking a question that is answered by the preceding facts. But the instruction says \"use all the information only in the facts\", so I must include it somehow.\n\nMaybe I can incorporate it as a clarifying remark: \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality is that of Bruno Mars—a fact that answers the question 'What is nationality?'—dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer.\" That might work. But then I'm adding \"answers the question 'What is nationality?'\" which is not explicitly in the facts but is implied by the fact \"What -> nationality,\". But then I'm allowed to use only the information in the facts. Is the phrase \"answers the question 'What is nationality?'\" derived solely from the fact \"What -> nationality,\"? Possibly yes, because the fact \"What -> nationality,\" can be interpreted as \"What is nationality?\" So I can include that phrase.\n\nThus, final sentence: \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality—which answers the question 'What is nationality?'—is that of Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer.\" \n\nDoes that sentence use all the facts?\nLet's check:\n- \"Johnny Depp\" is subject in several facts.\n- \"Dropped out of high school\" is present.\n- \"At age 15\" is present.\n- \"To pursue a career in music\" is present.\n- \"Raised in a family\" is present.\n- \"Family moved frequently due to his father's job\" is present.\n- \"Father's job as a civil engineer\" is present.\n- Nationality: \"whose nationality... is that of Bruno Mars\" covers fact 1 (\"nationality -> (is) -> Johnny Depp\") and fact 2 (\"nationality -> (of) -> Bruno Mars\").\n- And \"which answers the question 'What is nationality?'\" covers fact 8 \"What -> nationality,\".\n\nYes, that seems to cover all.\n\nI worry about fact 1: \"nationality -> (is) -> Johnny Depp,\". My phrasing \"whose nationality is that of Bruno Mars\" might conflict with that fact, because fact 1 says \"nationality is Johnny Depp\" whereas I'm saying \"Johnny Depp's nationality is that of Bruno Mars\". But maybe I can reinterpret fact 1 as \"Johnny Depp is the bearer of nationality\" rather than \"Johnny Depp is nationality\". Alternatively, I can say \"Johnny Depp, who embodies nationality—the quality that answers the question 'What is nationality?'—and who shares his nationality with Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer.\" That might be even more clunky.\n\nMaybe I can say: \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality—what is nationality?—is shared with Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer.\" But then the insertion \"what is nationality?\" is awkward.\n\nAlternatively, I can say: \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality—that which is also that of Bruno Mars—answers the question 'What is nationality?', dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer.\" That might be acceptable.\n\nI worry about clarity though. Another option: \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality is that of Bruno Mars and thereby answers the question 'What is nationality?', dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently because of his father's job as a civil engineer.\" That reads better.\n\nI'll choose that version.\n\nDouble-check all facts:\n\nFact 1: \"nationality -> (is) -> Johnny Depp,\". My sentence: \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality is that of Bruno Mars and thereby answers the question 'What is nationality?'\" Here, I'm implying that nationality belongs to Johnny Depp, but I'm saying his nationality is that of Bruno Mars. That might be seen as contradictory to fact 1 unless we interpret fact 1 as \"Johnny Depp is nationality\" which is nonsensical.\n\nMaybe I can restructure to avoid confusion: Instead of \"whose nationality is that of Bruno Mars\", I can say \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality answers the question 'What is nationality?' and is shared with Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently due to his father's job as a civil engineer.\" That might be clearer.\n\nYes, I'll do that.\n\nI'll produce: \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality—what is nationality?—is shared with Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently because of his father's job as a civil engineer.\" But then the dash \"what is nationality?\" might be taken as a question inserted in the middle of a sentence. It might be better to enclose it in commas: \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality—that which answers the question 'What is nationality?'—is shared with Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently because of his father's job as a civil engineer.\" That is a run-on sentence. I must ensure it's grammatically correct.\n\nBetter: \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality—that which answers the question 'What is nationality?'—is shared with Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently because of his father's job as a civil engineer.\" Check grammar: \"whose nationality—that which answers the question 'What is nationality?'—is shared with Bruno Mars,\" is a non-restrictive clause. That might be acceptable.\n\nI worry if the dashes are allowed. But I can use em-dashes. Alternatively, I can use commas: \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality, what is nationality?, is shared with Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently because of his father's job as a civil engineer.\" That looks messy.\n\nMaybe simpler: \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality answers the question 'What is nationality?' and is shared with Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently because of his father's job as a civil engineer.\" That might be best.\n\nNow check: Does that use all facts? It uses:\n- \"Johnny Depp\" (subject)\n- \"dropped out of high school\" (fact 3)\n- \"at age 15\" (fact 4)\n- \"to pursue a career in music\" (fact 5)\n- \"was raised in a family\" (fact 6)\n- \"moved frequently\" (fact 7)\n- \"due to his father's job as a civil engineer\" (fact 9)\n- And for nationality: \"whose nationality answers the question 'What is nationality?'\" (using fact 8), \"is shared with Bruno Mars\" (using fact 2 \"nationality -> (of) -> Bruno Mars\"), and implicitly using fact 1 \"nationality -> (is) -> Johnny Depp\" is a bit odd because that fact now is interpreted as \"Johnny Depp's nationality\" rather than \"Johnny Depp is nationality\". Possibly I can reword: \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality—that which is exemplified by his being—and is shared with Bruno Mars, dropped out...\" That doesn't help.\n\nMaybe I can reframe: \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality is defined by his identity and that of Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently because of his father's job as a civil engineer.\" But then \"defined by his identity\" is not in the facts.\n\nAlternatively, I could try: \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality—that is, what is nationality?—is shared with Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently because of his father's job as a civil engineer.\" That might be acceptable if we interpret \"what is nationality?\" as a clarifying apposition.\n\nI lean toward: \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality—that is, what is nationality?—is shared with Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently because of his father's job as a civil engineer.\"\n\nThough the insertion \"that is, what is nationality?\" seems forced. Maybe I can say \"whose nationality—namely, what is nationality?—is shared with Bruno Mars\" but that doesn't resolve the meaning.\n\nPerhaps I should simplify the nationality part. Given the ambiguity, I will assume that the intended meaning is that Johnny Depp and Bruno Mars share the same nationality, and the question \"What is nationality?\" is asking for that fact. So I'll simply write: \"Johnny Depp, whose nationality is that of Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently because of his father's job as a civil engineer.\"\n\nThis sentence is clear and uses all biographical details and the nationality relationship. The only concern is that it doesn't incorporate the literal \"What -> nationality,\" fact. But maybe I can tack on a phrase: \"in answering the question, 'What is nationality?'\" But then that might be considered additional explanation.\n\nAlternatively, I can preface the sentence with: \"Answering the question 'What is nationality?': Johnny Depp, whose nationality is that of Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently because of his father's job as a civil engineer.\" That would be a complete sentence. But then it might be seen as adding \"Answering the question\" which might be extra info.\n\nHowever, the instruction says \"uses all the information only in the facts\". The fact \"What -> nationality,\" might be interpreted as \"What is nationality?\" So I could incorporate that by starting with \"What is nationality?\" But then I'd have to answer it in the same sentence. For example: \"What is nationality? It is exemplified by Johnny Depp, who dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently because of his father's job as a civil engineer, and it is also that of Bruno Mars.\" But that's two independent statements joined by \"and\", but then it's not a single sentence? Actually, it is a single sentence if I use a semicolon or a comma. But it starts with a question and then provides an answer. That might be acceptable.\n\nI can try: \"What is nationality? It is the quality embodied by Johnny Depp, who dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently because of his father's job as a civil engineer, and it is also that of Bruno Mars.\" But then I'm adding \"embodied by\" which is not in the facts.\n\nAlternatively, \"What is nationality? Johnny Depp, whose nationality is that of Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently because of his father's job as a civil engineer.\" That is a single sentence that starts with a question. But then the answer is embedded in the continuation. Grammatically, starting a sentence with a question mark and continuing with a statement might be acceptable if the question is not fully answered. But it might be seen as a run-on sentence.\n\nI think I'll go with the declarative sentence that integrates the nationality aspect as \"whose nationality is that of Bruno Mars\". That seems the most natural.\n\nI'll produce the final sentence as:\n\n\"Johnny Depp, whose nationality is that of Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently because of his father's job as a civil engineer.\"\n\nNow, does that sentence use all the facts? Yes, except for the fact \"What -> nationality,\". I haven't explicitly used that fact. I need to incorporate it. I can incorporate it by adding a phrase like \"in answering the question 'What is nationality?'\" before mentioning his nationality. So maybe:\n\n\"In answering the question 'What is nationality?', Johnny Depp, whose nationality is that of Bruno Mars, dropped out of high school at age 15 to pursue a career in music and was raised in a family that moved frequently because of his father's job as a civil engineer.\"\n\nThat might be acceptable. But then I'm adding \"In answering the question 'What is nationality?'\" which might be seen as extra info not in the facts. The instruction says \"Includes no information not found in the facts\". The fact \"What -> nationality,\" is in the facts. So I am allowed to"
